Looking Back: An Update

In  the  last  ten  years  since  writing  this  book,  my  astrology  studies  and  research
continued  and  my  knowledge  has  been  considerably  refined.  I  have  refined  several
calculations  and  concepts  shared  in  this  book,  based  on  my  studies,  insights  and
experimentation. I may try to edit this book or write a new book in future, reflecting
the refinements in knowledge. However, I think that the book may still be useful for
clarifying some basic concepts and preparing the ground for advanced studies. So I
am sharing this book freely with all.

Some of my researches are shared as free articles on

Vedic Astrology:
An Integrated Approach

First Published in 2000

Lord  of  the  Universe,  destroyer  of  demon  Madhu,  beacon  of  Yadu
community, preceptor of Gita, giver of Knowledge, cowherd, one who is
prayed by Shiva – the destroyer of Love God, beloved of Gopis, one who
is filled with tempting charm, Krishna, born in Vrishni lineage, the Final
Preceptor  with  nothing  beyond  or  after,  a  complete  Incarnation,  Vishnu,
Govinda,  leader  of  Gods  —  may  He  always  bless  me,  Narasimha  (Rao),
who is bowed before Him.

Dedication

This book is humbly dedicated to the lotus feet of three great men from
whom I learnt Jyotish:

1.  Sri  P.  Venkata  Subrahmanyachalapathi

Rao (my father and my first guru),

2.  Dr.  B.  V.  Raman  (immortal  author  who
rendered great yeoman’s service to Jyotish), and,

3.  Pt. Sanjay Rath (author, my guru and founder

of “Sri Jagannath Vedic Centre”).

My only qualification for writing this book, apart from great enthusiasm
to share my little knowledge with others, is the little knowledge I gained
from  the  above  three  gurus.  Whatever  flows  from  my  pen  (or  rather
computer  keyboard)  is  due  to  the  knowledge  and  blessings  I  received
from  Mahavishnu  and  the  above  three  great  men.  This  book  really
belongs to them and not to me1.

1 But any mistakes in this book are mine.

Preface

With  the  Creator  said  to  be  one  of  its  eighteen  great  preceptors,  Jyotish  or  Vedic
astrology is thought to be as old as this creation is. There are many excellent books
on  Jyotish  written  in  Sanskrit  language  by  great  Maharshis  and  brilliant  scholars.
Thanks to the yeoman service rendered by Dr. B.V. Raman and the efforts of other
Indian astrologers to follow him, today we have a fair amount of Jyotish literature in
English language too.

Considering the wealth of Vedic astrology literature in Sanskrit and English, another
book  may  not  really  be  needed.  Even  if  another  book  is  needed,  there  are  many
erudite  scholars  who  are  better  equipped  than  me  to  write.  Nevertheless,  I  wanted,
like  a  parrot  that  enthusiastically  repeats  the  few  words  learnt  by  it,  to  share  with
fellow students the little knowledge I received from classics and from my gurus.

In this book, I covered divisional charts, special ascendants, arudhas, argalas, yogas,
ashtakavarga,  avasthas,  a  few  nakshatra  dasas,  a  few  rasi  dasas,  several  techniques
of transit analysis, Tajaka analysis and a few miscellaneous topics.

I  tried  to  give  prominence  to  special  ascendants,  divisional  charts  and  arudhas,
because  contemporary  literature  doesn't  seem  to  give  them  the  kind  of  importance
that  Sage  Parasara  gave.  Understanding  the  primacy  Parasara  gave  to  all  these
concepts is a must for a renaissance in Vedic astrology.

Unfortunately, some people think today that Parasara and Jaimini taught two totally
different  approaches to astrology. When we talk  about arudha padas, argalas, chara
karakas, chara dasa and other rasi dasas, people think of them as “Jaimini astrology”.
People  even  use  terms  like  “Jaimini  karakas”  and  “Jaimini  dasas”.  However,  all
these  concepts  were  covered  by  Parasara  also  (please  read  “Brihat  Parasara  Hora
Sastram”).  The  “Parasari  vs  Jaimini”  distinction
is  based  on  unfortunate
misconceptions that we can do away with.

In  this  book,  I  have  de-emphasized  these  wrong  distinctions  and  emphasized  an
integrated approach – a holistic approach – that looks at Vedic astrology as a whole.
I really think that this is the right approach.

In the part on dasas,  I  covered  Vimsottari dasa  and Ashtottari dasa,  as they  are the
most  commonly  used  nakshatra  dasas.  Kalachakra  dasa  was  termed  the  “most
respectable dasa” by Parasara and a discussion on dasas cannot be complete without
it.  In the  galaxy of dasas, rasi dasas taught by Parasara and Jaimini have their own
place  and  I  covered  two  rasi  dasas  used  for  timing  material  success  –  Lagna
Kendradi  Rasi  dasa  and  Sudasa.  I  also  covered  Narayana  dasa,  which  is  the  most
versatile  rasi  dasa  taught  by  maharshis.  For  the  spiritually  inclined,  I  included
Drigdasa, which can help us in timing events in one’s spiritual evolution. Because of
the importance of the topic of longevity, I covered two ayur dasas – Shoola dasa and
Niryaana Shoola Dasa.

In  the  part  on  transits,  I  covered  the  interpretation  of  transits  based  on  the  natal
positions  of  planets  in  rasi  chart  and  divisional  charts.  I  covered  some  techniques
based on ashtakavarga and sodhya pindas. I also covered several techniques related
to transits in nakshatras.

In the part on Tajaka, I covered the casting of Tajaka annual, monthly and sixty-hour
charts,  their  interpretation,  Tajaka  yogas  and  three  dasas  used  for  timing  events  in
Tajaka  charts.  Some  scholars  may  validly  question  why  Tajaka  system  is  being
covered in a book on Vedic astrology. There are no references to it in the works of
Parasara, Jaimini and other maharshis. The oldest reference to these techniques to be
found  in  the  works  of  a  respected  authority  on  Vedic  astrology  is  in  “Tajaka
Neelakanthi”,  a  work  by  Neelakantha  who  also  wrote  a  celebrated  commentary  on
“Jaimini  Sutras”.  His  coverage  of  Tajaka  system  lends  some  authenticity  to  the
system.  One  can  only  speculate  whether  Parasara  talked  about  this  system  in  parts
that  are  possibly  missing  today.  I  simply  followed  the  precedent  set  by  illustrious
scholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V. Raman.

When we rely on finer techniques of Vedic astrology – such as divisional charts and
special lagnas – for finer predictions, it is crucial to have an accurate birthtime. The
chapter “Impact of Birthtime Error” shows how to cope with birthtime inaccuracies.

While I am upset with the dismissal of astrology by some critics as a ‘superstition’, I
am  equally,  if  not  more,  upset  with  the  irrational  and  unscientific  attitude  of  some
astrologers. In an effort to promote rational thinking in the astrological community, I
included a chapter on “Rational Thinking”.

A very brief introduction to some special topics such as remedial measures, mundane
astrology  and  muhurtas  is  provided  in  this  book  and  it  is  hoped  that  interested
readers will pursue these topics further by referring to other textbooks.

Vedic  astrology  is  considered  a  sacred  subject  and  Maharshi  Parasara  warned  us
against  sharing  this  knowledge  with  unworthy  people.  Ancient  Sages  laid  down
some rules for the ethical behavior of a Vedic astrologer. I earnestly hope that all the
readers  of  this  book  will  appreciate  those  rules.  To  that  end,  I  added  a  chapter  on
“Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi”.

While no particular topic has been covered in great depth, most key fundamentals are
covered  in  this  book.  Most  fundamental  concepts  and  computations  are  clearly
defined with examples and their uses are briefly  outlined. But  I do not want to bill
this as a comprehensive introduction for beginners. There are parts of this book that
can  be  followed  even  by  beginners,  but  an  average  beginner  may  find  it
overwhelming  in  many  places.  For  most  part,  this  book  is  for  intermediate  level
students  who  already  have  a  good  background,  but  are  in  need  of  integrating  and
consolidating their knowledge. However, there are some points in some places that
can be appreciated only by advanced scholars. So I will not make any claims on who
will  find  this  book  useful.  Rather  than  targeting  readership  with  a  specific  level  of
knowledge,  I  tried  to  write  a  more  or  less  self-sufficient  book  that  covers  a  wide
spectrum  of  topics.  Beginners  should  read  this  book  very  carefully,  and  more  than
once,  to  completely  understand  various  concepts.  Though  I  have  tried  to  maintain
some level of clarity,  I squeezed in a lot of material and beginners should patiently
read, re-read and practice.

Due  to  my  background  in  engineering,  I  tried  to  adopt  a  style  somewhat  similar  to
the one used in mathematics and physics textbooks. I tried to be concise and always
to the point. I gave plenty of examples and even some exercises. I hope that students
will read the material  and examples carefully  and attempt the  exercises sincerely.  I
hope that the astrological community will accept this new style of astrology teaching.

In this book, I did not try to steer clear of the controversies plaguing Vedic astrology.
As  my  purpose  in  writing  this  book  is  to  chronicle  my  broad  understanding  of
Jyotish in a clear and concise fashion and to give clear guidance to fellow students, I
stated my views clearly except in issues in which I do not have a firm opinion.

This  book  probably  contains  some  fine  knowledge,  due  to  the  blessings  I  received
from  my  gurus,  and  some  wrong  knowledge  as  well,  due  to  the  limitations  of  my
intelligence.  Giving  fine  knowledge  to  unworthy  students  and  feeding  wrong
knowledge  to  worthy  students  are  both  mistakes  and  I  am  aware  that  I  may  be
committing both. I beg for the forgiveness of my gurus, maharshis and gods.

A  free  computer  software  program  written  by  me  called  “Jagannatha  Hora”  is
available  for  a  free  download  on  my  website  (http://www.VedicAstrologer.org).  It
can  compute  the  positions  of  all  planets,  upagrahas,  lagna,  special  lagnas,  arudha
padas  and  ashtakavarga  for  twenty  divisional  charts.  It  supports  several  popular
ayanamsas. It gives Shadbalas, Vimsottari, Ashtottari and Kalachakra dasas and also
gives  Tajaka  annual  charts,  Patyayini  dasa,  Mudda  dasa,  Panchavargeeya  Bala  and
Sahams. Those who have a computer with a Microsoft operating system (Windows
95 or later) can download and use this software.

As  I  dedicated  most  of  my  free  time  in  the  last  few  years  to  astrology  reading,
research and writing, my wife Padmaja, my daughter Sriharini and my son Sriharish
made  a  personal  sacrifice  and  co-operated  with  my  astrological  activities.  I  am
thankful to them for their co-operation.

I  cannot  possibly  finish  this  preface  without  expressing  my  deep  gratitude  for  my
guru  Pt.  Sanjay  Rath,  who  has  been  a  constant  source  of  enlightenment,
encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him. I express my gratitude
to all the elders and well-wishers whose blessings gave me the energy to finish this
book.  I  hope  that  I  will  be  forgiven  for  any  mistakes  and  that  I  will  continue  to
receive their kind blessings.

May Jupiter’s light shine on us,

Part 1:   Chart Analysis

Several  important  principles  and  techniques  of  chart  analysis
are explained in this part. This part forms the basis for the rest
of the book.

Based on the positions of all the planets when a person is born,
several charts are prepared. They go by the names – “rasi chart”
and  “divisional  charts”.  Based  on  the  analysis  of  these  charts,
several conclusions can be drawn regarding the results that can
be given by different planets to the native. This part covers the
analysis and judgment of these charts.

It  can  help  if  the  reader  has  basic  understanding  and  prior
knowledge  of  Vedic  or  western  astrology,  but  it  is  not  really
required.  This  part  is  intended  to  be  self-sufficient.  However,
bear in mind that extra reading can only do good!

1.   Basic Concepts

1.1  What is astrology

Planets are constantly in motion with respect to earth in the skies. The positions of
Sun,  Moon  and  some  planets  close  to  earth  can  give  important  clues  about  the
fortunes of individual human beings and groups of human beings. That is the basic
premise  of  astrology.  How  exactly  we  can  make  guesses  about  the  fortunes  of
individual human beings and groups of human beings based on the positions of those
planets in the skies is the question that we will attempt to answer in this book. While
astrology  is  the  subject  that  deals  with  this  question,  there  are  many  theories  and
philosophies in vogue and they are significantly different from each other.

Sunsign astrology, for example, is based on categorizing people into 12 groups based
on  the  solar  month  of  birth.  Some  people  may  be  convinced,  based  on  their
experiences,  that  people  born  in  the  same  month  share  certain  qualities.  It  is,
however,  not  very  logical  from  a  rational  perspective  –  there  are  just  too  many
people in this world, who are totally different from each other. So the month of one's
birth is totally inadequate for guessing one's nature or fortune. Even the date and the
hour of birth are not enough. We know that there are many twins in this world, who
are significantly different from each other!

What  we  mentioned  just  now  is,  by  the  way,  a  very  important  question  to  be
answered  –  it  is  like  an “acid  test”  for  any  astrological  doctrine.  It  is  a  known  fact
that  there  are  many  twins  in  this  world,  who  are  significantly  different  from  each
other  and  who  lead  totally  different  lives.  Of  course,  some  twins  may  have  some
common  qualities  between  them,  but  the  fact  remains  that  several  twins  are
significantly different. An astrological doctrine should be capable of explaining this
fact in order to be considered as a meaningful subject.

Most astrological doctrines of the world fail this acid test. If an astrological doctrine
assumes, like in the case of many popular astrological theories of the world, that two
persons  born  within  a  couple  of  hours  in  nearby  towns  will  have  the  same  fortune,

  4

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

then that doctrine is obviously lacking in completeness and inadequate for confident
use in real-life. It fails the acid test of twins.

1.2

India's astrology

Materialistically  speaking,  India  may  not  be  a  rich  country  today,  but  India  has
extremely  rich  cultural  heritage.  The  depth  of  some  of  India's  ancient  knowledge
(like astrology) is just amazing and it makes one wonder if the history of this great
civilization  is  correctly  represented  in  the  pages  of  modern  history.  Astrology  of
India  is  the  most  comprehensive  and  complete  system  of  astrology  available  today
and  it  is  the  only  one  that  comes  close  to  answering  the  just  mentioned  “twins
puzzle”.  India's  astrology  can  explain  how  twins  can  be  different.  The  principles
used  in  India's  astrology  are  so  sensitive  to  changes  in  birthtime  that  people  born
within 1-2 minutes can be significantly different in some aspects and similar in some
others.  This  approach  distinguishes  between  what  a  person  truly  is,  what  a  person
wants  to  be,  what  he  thinks  he  is  and  what  the  world  thinks  he  is.  It  has  enough
parameters,  tools,  techniques  and  degrees  of  freedom  to  model  the  extremely
complicated human life.

This astrological approach is known in the world by many names. Early pioneers of
modern Indian astrology, like Dr. B.V. Raman, called it “Hindu astrology”, because
this  system  was  first  taught  by  ancient  Hindu  sages.  However,  some  people  do  not
like  this  expression  because  “Hindu”  is  not  a  Sanskrit  word.  This  word  was  later
coined by the western invaders from the name of a river flowing on the northwestern
border of India (river “Sindhu” or “Indus”). They used the word “Hindu” to describe
the land and the people on the eastern side of this river.

The religion practiced by a majority of Indians is known as “Hindu” religion today,
but the fact is that there is no name for this religion in India's Sanskrit language, the
language in which most of the literature of this religion – and astrology – appeared!
Most  other  religions  are  known  by  the  name  of  their  main  propagator,  but  India's
ancient  religion  had  no  single  propagator  or  prophet.  This  religion  consisted  of
knowledge that revealed itself to spiritual masters of many generations. So there was
no  name  for  this  religion  and  the  word  “Hindu”  coined  by  western  invaders  was
accepted  by  the  world.  However,  as  already  stressed,  this  word  finds  no  place  in
Sanskrit  literature.  Some  people  do  not  like  using  a  non-Sanskrit  word  to  describe

Part 1: Chart Analysis

5

India's  astrology,  considering  that  most  of  India's  classical  literature  in  astrology
appeared in Sanskrit.

Later  day  authors  came  up  with  the  name  –  “Vedic  astrology".  The  word  “Vedic”
means  “pertaining  to  Vedas".  Vedas  are  the  sacred  scriptures  of,  what  is  known
today  as,  Hinduism  and  they  are  supposed  to  contain  knowledge  of  all  subjects.
Moreover,  astrology  in  particular  is  supposed  to  be  a  “Vedaanga”  (which  means  a
limb  of  Vedas).  In  particular,  it  is  said  to  be  the  eye  of  the  Vedas.  So  the  name
“Vedic  astrology”  is  becoming  popular  these  days.  This  author  also  suggests  using
“Vedic astrology” or “Jyotish” (meaning “science of light"). Jyotishi is a practitioner
of Jyotish, i.e. a Vedic astrologer.

1.3  Basics
1.3.1  Grahas (planets)

The words “planet” and “star” are used in a slightly different sense in astrology than
in  astronomy.  For  example,  Sun  (a  star)  and  Moon  (a  satellite  of  earth)  are  called
planets in astrology, along with Mars etc. Basically, a graha or a planet is a body that
has considerable influence on the living beings on earth. Distant stars have negligible
influence on us, but Sun, Moon and planets in the solar system have a great influence
on our activities. So the word graha (or planet) is used to describe them.

Seven  planets  are  considered  in  Indian  astrology.  They  are  –  Sun,  Moon,  Mars,
Mercury,  Jupiter,  Venus  and  Saturn.  In  addition,  two  “chaayaa  grahas”  (shadow
planets) are considered in Indian astrology – Rahu and Ketu. These are also called
“the north node” and “the south node” respectively (or the head and tail of dragon).
Rahu and Ketu are not real planets; they are just some mathematical points.

Apart  from  these  9  planets,  there  are  11  moving  mathematical  points  known  as
Upagrahas (sub-planets or satellites). We also have lagna (ascendant), which is the
point that rises on the eastern horizon as the earth rotates around itself. In addition,
we have some mathematical points known as “special ascendants".

1.3.2  Rasis (signs)

  6

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

The positions of all these planets, upagrahas, lagna and special lagnas in the zodiac
are measured in degrees, minutes and seconds from the start of the zodiac (which is a
fixed point in the sky). These positions are measured as seen from earth and they are
called  “geocentric  positions".  For  the  positions  (calculated  in  degrees,  minutes  and
seconds)  of  planets,  lagna,  special  lagnas  and  upagrahas,  we  also  use  the  words
longitude and sphuta. When watched from earth, the longitude of any planet in the
skies can be from 0°0'0'' (0 degrees 0 minutes 0 seconds) to 359°59'59''. It should be
noted  that  0°0'0''  corresponds  to  the  beginning  of  the  zodiac.  Many  western
astrologers  consider  Sayana  or  tropical  (moving)  zodiac,  whereas  Nirayana  or
sidereal (fixed) zodiac is considered in Vedic astrology.

The zodiac (sky) lasts 360° as mentioned above and it is divided into 12 equal parts.
They  are  called  “rasis”  (signs).  English  names,  Sanskrit  names,  two-letter  symbols
and  values  of  the  start  longitude  and  the  end  longitude  (in  degrees,  minutes  and
seconds) of all twelve rasis are given in Table 1.

Notation: If a planet is at 221°37', then you can find from Table 1 that it is between
210°0'0''  and  239°59'59''.  So,  that  planet  is  in  Scorpio  (or  Vrischika).  Its
advancement  from  the  start  of  the  rasi  occupied  by  is  11°37'.  Its  position  in  the
zodiac (221°37') is shown by some people by the notation 11°°°°37' in Sc or simply 11
Sc 37. This means “advanced by 11°37' from the start of Sc (Scorpio)". Some people

show it as 7s 11° 37'. This means “after completing 7 signs, advanced by 11°37' in
the 8th sign (which is Scorpio)".

Exercise 1:
Jupiter is at 94°19'. Mercury is at 5s 17° 45'. Venus is at 25 Li 31. For each of these
planets, find (a) the rasi occupied and (b) the advancement from the start of the rasi
occupied.

Each rasi again has many kinds of divisions and they are called “vargas". They will
be defined in detail later.

1.3.3  Bhavas (houses)

Another important concept is “house” (Sanskrit name: bhava). In each chart, houses
can be found with respect to several reference points and the reference points most
commonly employed are lagna and special lagnas. Starting from the rasi occupied by
the selected reference point and proceeding in the regular order across the zodiac, we
associate  each  rasi  with  a  house  (first,  second  etc).  Always  the  rasi  containing  the
reference point chosen is the 1st house. Next rasi is the 2nd house. The rasi after that
is the 3rd house. We proceed until the 12th house like that. Just remember that when
we encounter Pisces, we go to Aries after it. If no reference point is specified when
houses are mentioned, it means that lagna is used as the reference.

If,  for  example,  horalagna  is  in  Cn,  first  house  with  respect  to  horalagna  is  in  Cn.
Second house is in Le (see Table 1). Third house is in Vi. Ninth house is in Pi. Tenth
house is in Ar. Eleventh house is in Ta. Twelfth house is in Ge.

Exercise 2:

(1) Lagna is in Cn, Sun is in Ar, Moon is in Ta and Mars is in Cp. Find the houses

occupied by Sun, Moon and Mars.

(2) Repeat the exercise, taking Moon as the reference point when finding houses.

Different  houses  stand  for  different  matters.  Looking  at  the  rasis  and  houses
occupied  by  various  planets,  we  can  say  a  lot  of  things  about  the  person.  How
exactly this is done will become clear in coming chapters.

1.3.4  Chakras (charts)

A  “chart”  (Sanskrit  name:  chakra)  is  prepared  with  the  information  of  rasis
occupied by all planets. For preparing any chart, we need to first determine the rasis
occupied  by  all  planets,  upagrahas,  lagna  and  special  lagnas.  In  the  visual
representation of a chart, there are 12 boxes (are some other visual areas) with each
representing  a  rasi.  All  planets,  upagrahas  and  lagnas  are  written  in  the  boxes
corresponding to the rasis they occupy.

There  are  3  popular  ways  of  drawing  charts  in  India:  (1)  South  Indian  style  chart
ruled by Jupiter, (2) North  Indian style diamond  chart ruled by Venus and (3) East
Indian  style  Sun  chart  ruled  by  Sun.  In  this  book,  all  the  charts  will  be  given  in
formats (1) and (2).

Out of the three chart formats, (1) and (3) are rasi-based and (2) is bhava-based.  In
rasi-based chart drawing formats, a rasi is always at a fixed position. Ar is always in
one particular position and Ta is in another position and so on. Planets, lagna etc are
placed in the box (or the visual area) representing the rasi occupied by it. In bhava-
based  chart  drawing  formats,  a  bhava  (house)  is  always  at  a  fixed  position.  Lagna
(denoted by “Asc” for ascendant) is always in a particular visual area of the chart and
the 2nd, 3rd etc houses are in fixed positions.

Example 1: Let us take Lord Sree Rama’s rasi chart. The rasis occupied by planets
and lagna are given below.

Ar – Sun; Ta – Mercury; Ge – Ketu; Cn – Ascendant (lagna), Moon & Jupiter; Li –
Saturn; Sg – Rahu; Cp – Mars; Pi – Venus.

Figure 1: Indian Chart Styles

Rasi chart for the above data is drawn in South Indian, North Indian and East Indian
formats in Figure 1. In the south Indian chart, notice the boxes containing Ar, Ta, Ge
etc. In this format, these rasis will always be in the same positions. The same holds
for  the  east  Indian  format.  The  north  Indian  format  is  different.  Note  the  box
containing “Asc” (ascendant – lagna). The same box will show the house containing

  10

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

lagna in all north Indian format charts. It may be Ar in one chart, Ta in another and
Ge in yet another. The number corresponding to the rasi (1 for Ar, 2 for Ta, 3 for Ge
and so on) is shown in the box. For example, the box with “Asc” has 4 in it and it
shows  Cn.  So  the  1st  house  is  in  Cn.  Please  note  the  order  in  which  houses  are
visually arranged in this chart. The same pattern will be used in all charts.

NOTE: Some people draw the east Indian format charts with an enclosing rectangle.

1.3.5  Varga chakras (divisional charts)

We  saw  that  charts  can  be  drawn  with  the  information  of  which  planet  occupies
which  rasi.  Based  on  the  longitude  of  a  planet,  we  can  find  the  rasi  occupied  by  it
and mark its position in rasi chart.

In  addition,  we  have  what  are  known  as  “divisional  charts”  (Sanskrit  name:  varga
chakras).  These  are  based  on  dividing  rasis  into 2  parts,  3  parts,  4  parts and  so  on.
We divide each rasi into n parts and map each part to a rasi again. Based on the rasis
occupied  by  planets  in  these  divisional  mappings,  we  draw  divisional  charts  (or
harmonic charts). Each divisional chart throws light on a specific area of one’s life.
In  each  divisional  chart,  we  find  houses  and  analyze  the  chart  as  if  it  were  an
independent chart. The science of Vedic astrology stands on the basis of 4 pillars –
(1) grahas or planets, (2) rasis or signs, (3) bhavas or houses, and, (4) varga chakras
or divisional charts.

1.3.6  Nakshatras (constellations)

In  Vedic  astrology,  the  zodiac  is  divided  into  27  nakshatras.  Each  nakshatra  has  a
length  of  360º/27  =  13º  20'.  The  first  nakshatra,  for  example,  stretches  from  the
beginning of Aries to 13º 20' in Aries. The second nakshatra stretches from there to
26º 40' in Aries. The third nakshatra stretches from there to 10º in Taurus. The list of
nakshatras  with  the  respective  starting  and  ending  points  is  given  in  Table  2.  The
table also gives the “Vimsottari lords” of all nakshatras. This will be used later.

Each  nakshatra  is  again  divided  into  4  quarters.  They  are  called  padas  (legs/feet).
The length of a nakshatra pada is 3º 20'.

Solar Calendar

  12

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

In solar calendar, one year is the time in which Sun moves by 360° and one month is
the time in which Sun moves by 30°. These are called “solar year” and “solar month”
respectively.  Each  solar  month  has  30  days,  where  one  day  stands  for  exactly  1°
motion of Sun). This calendar will be used in dasas and in Tajaka analysis.

Tithis and Lunar Calendar

1.3.8.1

Tithis

In lunar calendar, one day stands for one tithi. Tithi or lunar day is a period in which
the difference between the longitudes of Moon and Sun changes by exactly 12°.

When Sun and Moon are at the same longitude, a new lunar month of 30 tithis starts.
As time progresses, Moon will go ahead of Sun. When Moon’s longitude is exactly
12° greater than Sun’s longitude, the first tithi or lunar day finishes and the second
tithi starts. When Moon’s longitude is exactly 24° greater than Sun’s longitude, the
second tithi finishes and the third tithi starts. When Moon’s longitude is exactly 36°
greater than Sun’s longitude, the third tithi finishes and the fourth tithi starts. And so
on. You can see that Sun-Moon longitude differential will be (12 x n)° after exactly n
tithis.

A  lunar  month  consists  of  30  tithis.  Each  month  is  divided  into  two  fortnights
(pakshas).  During  Sukla/Suddha  paksha  or  the  brighter  fortnight,  Moon  is  waxing.
During this paksha, Moon is ahead of Sun by an amount that is between 0º and 180º.
During Krishna/Bahula paksha or the darker fortnight, Moon is waning. During this
paksha, Moon is ahead of Sun by an amount that is between 180º and 360º.

At the end of a month, Sun-Moon longitude differential will be (12 x 30)°, i.e., 360°.
That means that Moon will finish one cycle around the zodiac and catch up with Sun
again.  So  Sun  and  Moon  will  be  at  the  same  longitude  again.  Then  a  new  month
starts.

We can find the tithi running on a day from the longitudes of Sun and Moon using
the following procedure.

(1) Find the difference: (Moon’s longitude – Sun’s longitude). Add 360° if the result
is negative. The result will be between 0° and 360° and will show how advanced
Moon is with respect to Sun.

(2) Divide this result by 12°. Ignore the remainder and take the quotient.
(3) Add 1 to the quotient. You get a number from 1 to 30. That will give the index of

the tithi running.

(4) Refer to Table 3 and find the name of the tithi. There are 15 tithis and the same
tithis repeat in the brigher and darker fortnights. For example, it can be seen from
the  table  that  the  22th  tithi  out  of  the  30  tithis  is  in  Krishna  paksha  and  it  is
Saptami.  So  the  22nd  tithi  is  “Krishna  Saptami”.  We  write  the  classification  of
fortnight  (Sukla  or  Krishna)  first  and  then  write  tithi  name.  “Sukla  Saptami”
stands  for  “Saptami”  in  the  brighter  fortnight  (sukla  paksha),  i.e.  the  7th  tithi.
“Krishna Saptami” stands for “Saptami” in the darker fortnight (krishna paksha),
i.e. the 22nd tithi.

  14

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 2:
Let  us  say  that  Moon  is  at  24°12'  in  Gemini.  This  is  (2 x  30°)  +  24°  12'  =  84°  12'
from the beginning of the zodiac.

Let  us  say  that  Sun  is  at  17°46'  in  Scorpio.  This  is  (7  x  30°)  +  17°  46'  =  227°  46'
from the beginning of the zodiac.

Moon  –  Sun  =  84°  12'  –  227°  46'  =  –(143°  34').  It  is  negative  because  Sun  is  at  a
higher longitude. We have to add 360° to it to make it positive. It becomes 216° 26'.
So this is the advancement of Moon with respect to Sun.

Converting this to a decimal number, we get 216.43°. We have to divide it by 12°.
We find 216.43 ÷ 12 and the quotient is 18. So 18 tithis are over. Adding 1 to it, we
get  19  and  so  the  19th  tithi  is  running.  Referring  to  Table  3,  we  see  that  this  is
“Chaturthi” tithi of Krishna paksha (darker fortnight). So it is “Krishna Chaturthi”.

Exercise 3: Moon is at 14°43' in Leo. Sun is at 28°13' in Capricorn. Find the running
tithi.

1.3.8.2

Lunar Months

We  said  that  a  new  lunar  month  starts  whenever  Sun  and  Moon  are  at  the  same
longitude.  Then  Moon  will  go  ahead  of  Sun  and,  after  about  29-30  days,  he  will
catch up with Sun again. A new lunar month will start again.

These lunar months go by special names. The name of a lunar month is decided by
the rasi in which Sun-Moon conjunction2 takes place. If Sun-Moon conjoin in Pisces,
for  example,  it  starts Chaitra  maasa.  These  names  come  from  the  constellation  that
Moon is most likely to occupy on the full Moon day. In the month that starts when
Sun and Moon conjoin in Pisces, Moon is likely to be in Chitra constellation (23°20'

2 Two planets are said to be in “conjunction” if they are exactly at the same longitude.
NOTE: However, we sometimes use this term approximately. If two planets are in the same sign, but
not exactly at the same longitude, we still say that they are in conjunction.

in Virgo to 6°40' in  Libra) on the  full Moon day (15th tithi – Pournimasya). So the
month is called Chaitra.

A  solar  year  has  about  365.2425  days,  but  a  lunar  year  only  has  about  355  days.
Once in every 3  years, this difference accumulates to one month and an extra lunar
month comes. This results in Sun-Moon conjunction coming twice in the same rasi.
For example, Sun-Moon conjunction took place at 0°23' in Taurus on May 15, 1999
at 5:35:32 pm (IST) and again at 28°29' in Taurus on June 14, 1999 at 12:33:27 am
(IST).  Sun-Moon  conjunction  in  Taurus  starts  Jyeshtha  maasa  (maasa  =  month)  as
per Table 4. So 1999 had 2 Jyeshtha maasas. One is called “Nija” Jeshtha maasa and
the  other  is  called  “Adhika”  Jyeshtha  maasa.  Nija  means  real  and  adhika  means
extra.  An  adhika  maasa  (extra  month)  comes  once  in  every  3  years  and  that
synchronizes the lunar years with solar years. This calendar has been in use in India
for millennia.

Example 3: Suppose Sun is at 23°50' in Cp and Moon is at 17°20' in Li. Then Sun’s
longitude is 23°50' + 9 x 30° = 293°50' and Moon’s longitude is 17°20' + 6x 30° =
197°20'.  The  sum  is  293°50'  +  197°20'  =  491°10'.  By  subtracting  360º,  we  get

131°10'. This is equivalent to 131 x 60 + 10 =  7870'. By dividing this with 800', we
get 9.8375. Ignoring the fraction, we get 9. Adding 1 to it, we get 10. From Table 5,
we see that the 10th yoga is “Ganda yoga”.

Exercise 4: Moon is at 14°43' in Leo. Sun is at 28°13' in Capricorn. Find the running
Sun-Moon yoga.

1.3.10  Karanas

Each tithi is divided into 2 karanas. There are 11 karanas: (1) Bava, (2) Balava, (3)
Kaulava, (4) Taitula, (5) Garija, (6) Vanija, (7) Vishti, (8) Sakuna, (9) Chatushpada,
(10) Naga, and, (11) Kimstughna. The first 7 karanas repeat 8 times starting from the
2nd  half  of  the  first  lunar  day  of  a  month.  The  last  4  karanas  come  just  once  in  a
month, starting from the 2nd half of the 29th lunar day and ending at the 1st half of the
first lunar day.

1.3.11  Hora

Each day starts at sunrise and ends at next day’s sunrise. This period is divided into
24  equal  parts  and  they  are  called  horas.  A  hora  is  almost  equal  to  an  hour.  These
horas  are  ruled  by  different  planets.  The  lords  of  hora  come  in  the  order  of
decreasing speed with respect to  earth: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury
and Moon. After Moon, we go back to Saturn and repeat the 7 planets.

The first hora of any day (i.e. a period of one hour following sunrise) is ruled by the
lord  of  the  weekday  (Sun  for  Sunday,  Moon  for  Monday,  Mars  for  Tuesday,
Mercury  for  Wednesday,  Jupiter  for  Thursday,  Venus  for  Friday  and  Saturn  for
Saturday). After that, we list planets in the order mentioned above.

For example, let us take 9:40 pm on a Wednesday on which sunrise was at 6:10 am.
The time elapsed since sunrise is 21:40 – 6:10 = 15:30. So the 16th hour since sunrise
was  running  then.  This  is  ruled  by  the  16th  planet  from  Mercury.  After  subtracting
multiples of 7 from 16, we get 2. So the hora (hour) is ruled by the 2nd planet from
Mercury.  From  the  list  given  above,  we  see  that  the  2nd  planet  from  Mercury  is
Moon. So Moon’s hora runs at 9:40 pm.

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

1.3.12  Panchaanga

Panchaanga means “one with 5 limbs”. Almanacs published in India with planetary
positions  are  traditionally  called  panchaangas.  Along  with  the  planetary  positions,
they  give  the  start  and  end  times  of tithi,  vaara  (week  day  –  Sunday,  Monday  etc),
nakshatra,  yoga  and  karana  running  on  each  day.  These  five  are  the  limbs  of
panchaanga.

When  we  choose  a  muhurta  (an  auspicious  time  for  starting  a  venture),  we  should
choose an auspicious tithi, vaara, nakshatra, yoga and karana.

1.3.13  Ayanamsa

Because  of  the  movement  in  earth’s  precession,  the  starting  point  of  the  tropical
zodiac  changes  slowly  (with  respect  to  fixed  stars).  Tropical  (sayana)  zodiac  is
analogous  to  measuring  the  positions  of  trees  and  buildings  sitting  in  a  slowly
moving bus. Sidereal (nirayana) zodiac, on the other hand, considers a fixed zodiac.
It  considers  the  motion  of  the  tropical  zodiac  (bus  in  our  analogy)  and  makes  an
adjustment  accordingly.  We  use  the  sidereal  zodiac  in  Vedic  astrology.  The
difference between the tropical zodiac and the sidereal zodiac is of great importance.
What  modern  ephemeris  gives  us  is  the  tropical  positions  of  planets.  To  convert
these  positions,  we  have  to  subtract  the  difference  between  the  two  zodiacs.  This
difference varies with time. As earth’s precession changes every year, the difference
between the tropical zodiac and the sidereal zodiac changes. This difference is called
“ayanamsa”  (sidereal  difference).  There  are  many  opinions  on  the  correct  value  of
ayanamsa, because nobody knows exactly which star is supposed to be the starting
point  of  the  real  zodiac.  We  will  use  Chitrapaksha/Lahiri  ayanamsa  in  this  book,
which is accepted by most Vedic astrologers of India.

1.4  Dasa Systems

Dasa  systems  are  a  hallmark  of  Vedic  astrology.  Vedic  astrology  has  hundreds  of
dasa system. Each dasa system divides one’s life into periods, sub-periods, sub-sub-
periods and so on. All the periods are ruled by different planets or rasis. Some dasa
systems  are  planet-based  and  some  are  rasi-based.  Each  dasa  system  is  good  at
showing  events  of  a  specific  nature.  For  each  dasa  system,  we  have  some  standard

Part 1: Chart Analysis

19

rules,  based  on  which  we  analyze  the  natal  chart  and  attribute  different  results  to
different  periods  and  sub-periods.  Each  dasa  system  comes  with  rules  for  dividing
one’s  life  into  periods  and  sub-periods  and  rules  for  attributing  different  results  to
different  periods,  based  on  the  planetary  positions  in  the  natal  chart.  These  periods
are called “dasas” or “mahadasas” (MD). Sub-periods are called “antardasas” (AD).
Sub-sub-periods are called “pratyantardasas” (PD).

Some  dasas  are  good  at  showing  matters  related  to  longevity  and  death.  They  are
called  “ayur  dasas”  (dasas  of  longevity).  Some  dasas  are  good  at  showing  general
results. They are called “phalita dasas” (dasas of general results).

Mind is a very important part of our existence and Moon governs it. Some dasas are
computed based on the nakshatra occupied by Moon and they are called “nakshatra
dasas”.  Some  dasas  are  based  on  the  rasis  occupied  by  planets  and  they  are  called
“rasi dasas”.

We  will  learn  10  different  dasa  systems  in  this  book.  Readers  should  not  look  at
these 10 dasas as ten different alternatives to look at the same life event. They should
instead be looked at as ways to look at 10 different aspects of the same life event. In
fact,  some  of  the  dasas  taught  in  this  book  are  limited  to  specific  matters.  For
example,  we  should  look  at  Drigdasa  for  spiritual  progress  and  we  should  look  at
Sudasa for money and wealth. Like that, some dasas are limited to specific matters.

1.5  Conclusion

The content of this chapter may be too rudimentary for most readers. However, for
beginners, it may be confusing.

The  content  of  the  first  several  chapters  of  this  book  may  seem  to  be  disjoint,  but
things  will  fall  in  place  as  we  go  on.  Readers  should  patiently  go  through  the
material in the order presented. One has to work hard on the basics. Once the basics
are clear, Vedic astrology is a very systematic subject.

Some Western astrologers mix Western astrology with Vedic astrology and bring in
progressions,  extra-Saturnine  planets  etc  into  Vedic  astrology.  It  is  silly  to  suggest
that  the  Sages  who  taught  such  brilliant  and  superfine  techniques  did  not  consider
some  planets  because  they  did  not  know  about  them.  Vedic  astrology  is  a  very

  20

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

logical  and  systematic  subject  and  there  is  no  need  to  corrupt  it.  There  are  some
techniques  of  western  astrology  that  are  not  used  by  most  contemporary  Vedic
astrologers but were taught by seers. We can accept those techniques. An example is
progressions. They were not taught by Parasara,  but they were taught by  Manu. So
we  can  accept  them.  But  the  use  of  Uranus,  Neptune  and  Pluto  were  not  taught  by
any  seers  of  Vedic  astrology.  We  should  first  strive  to  clearly  understand  the
teachings of maharshis. There is a lot of width and depth in the knowledge taught by
maharshis. Our focus should be on understanding their teachings correctly and not on
adding new things to the knowledge that we only superficially understand.

Western astrologers reading this book may have to unlearn some things they learnt
before, as they read this book.

2.   Rasis

2.1

Introduction

We  learnt  that  the  zodiac  of  360º  is  divided  into  12  equal  parts  of  30º.  We  learnt
these are  called rasis  (signs). We learnt the definition of rasis in Table  1. Different
rasis have different properties and they stand for different things. We will learn them
in this small chapter.

2.2  Characteristics of Rasis

2.2.1

Limbs of Vishnu

The whole zodiac is nothing but a manifestation of Lord Vishnu’s body. Aries is the
head. Taurus is the face. Gemini is the arms. Cancer is the heart. Leo is the stomach.
Virgo  is  the  hip.  Libra  is  the  space  below  navel.  Scorpio  is  the  private  parts.
Sagittarius is the thighs. Capricorn is the knees. Aquarius is the ankles. Pisces is the
feet.

These are the limbs that rasis in the natural zodiac stand for. Because we are all part
of  the  Supreme  energy  governing  this  world,  the  above  mapping  applies  to  us  too.
For example, we should pay attention to Leo for analyzing stomach problems and to
Pisces for analyzing problems related to feet and so on.

2.2.2  Odd and Even

(1) Ar, Ge, Le, Li, Sg and Aq are called odd rasis or vishama rasis or oja rasis. They

are also known as male rasis.

(2) Ta, Cn, Vi, Sc, Cp and Pi are called even rasis or sama rasis or yugma rasis. They

are also known as female rasis.

This division is used in some dasas and in the determination of the sex of children.

  22

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

2.2.3  Odd-footed and Even-footed

(1)  Ar,  Ta,  Ge,  Li,  Sc  and  Sg  are  called  odd-footed  rasis  or  vishamapada  rasis  or

ojapada rasis.

(2)  Cn,  Le,  Vi,  Cp,  Aq  and  Pi  are  called  even-footed  rasis  or  samapada  rasis  or  or

yugmapada rasis.

This division is used in some dasas.

2.2.4  Movable, Fixed and Dual

(1) Ar, Cn, Li and Cp are known as chara rasis or movable rasis. They are ruled by

Brahma, the Creator. Their nature is to move and to be dynamic.

(2) Ta,  Le,  Sc  and  Aq  are  known  as  sthira  rasis  or  fixed  rasis.  They  are  ruled  by

Shiva, the Destroyer. Their nature is to be stable and constant.

(3) Ge, Vi, Sg and Pi are known as dwiswabhava rasis or dual rasis. They are ruled
by Vishnu, the Sustainer.3 They are stable sometimes and dynamic sometimes.

2.2.5  Rasis & Five Elements

According  to  Hindu  philosophy,  this  world  is  made  up  of  5  elements  –  fire,  water,
air, earth and ether. Water is a substance with a flexible state. Air is a substance with
a  varying  state.  Earth  is  a  substance  with  a  constant  and  solid  state.  Fire  is  a
substance  that  transforms  the  state  of  things.  Ether  is  something  that  is  present
everywhere.

For  example, suppose one has  a  good memory  and remembers something he learnt
10  years  back.  It  involves  a  skill  of  earthy  nature.  Suppose  a  poet’s  imagination
creates a nice poem that appeals to one’s aesthetic sense. This involves watery skills.
Suppose one is in a bad mood and his mind is wandering aimlessly. This shows airy
state  of  the  mind.  These  5  elements  are  behind  every  material  substance,  every
action, every thought, every emotion and every happening in this universe.

3  Brahma,  Vishnu  and  Shiva  together  form  the  Trinity  of  Hindu  Gods.  Brahma  creates  the  world.
Vishnu sustains it. Shiva destroys it.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

(1) Ar, Le and Sg are called agni rasis or fiery rasis.

(2) Ta, Vi and Cp are called bhoo rasis or earthy rasis.

(3) Ge, Li and Aq are called vaayu rasis or airy rasis.

(4) Cn, Sc and Pi are called jala rasis or watery rasis.
(5) The 5th element of aakaasa or ether is present in every rasi.

Let us see how these may be used. For example, the 5th house in one’s chart shows
one’s  emotional  nature.  The  5th  house  in  a  fiery  sign  may  show  a  normally  angry,
aggressive  or  determined  person.  The  5th  house  in  an  earthy  sign  may  show  a
balanced, logical and stable person. The 5th house in an airy sign may show someone
with unstable and wandering emotions. The 5th house in a watery sign may show one
with an imaginative and creative mind.

2.2.6

Pitta, Vaata and Kapha

Ayurveda  is  India’s  Vedic  medical  system  that  recognizes  human  body  and
everything else in the universe as having 3 natures that are formed with the above 5
elements:

Pitta  or  bilious  nature  is  a  combination  of  the  elements  of  fire  and  water.  It  shows
things that result in tranformation in a system. In a human body, for example, it may
show digestion etc.

Vaata  or  windy  nature  is  a  combination  of  the  elements  of  air  and  ether.  It  shows
things that move in and out of a system. In a human body, for example, it may show
breathing etc.

Kapha or phlegmatic nature is a combination of the elements of earth and water. It
shows things that bind a system together. In a human body, for example, it may show
bones, muscles, fat etc. It shows things that give a structure to a system.

Ar, Le and Sg are of pitta nature. Ta, Vi and Cp are of vaata nature. Cn, Sc and Pi are
of kapha nature. Ge, Li and Aq are of a mixed nature.

2.2.7

Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas

In Hindu philosophy, everything in this universe has one of 3 gunas (qualities). They
are  called  trigunas.  Sattwa  (purity)  is  a  quality  that  gives  truthfulness  and  purity.
Rajas  or  rajo  guna  (energy)  is  a  quality  that  makes  one  energetic  and  passionate.
Tamas or tamo guna (darkness) is a quality that makes one depraved.

As  an  example,  let  us  say  a  saint  is  living  in  a  small  hermitage.  Let  us  say  a  man
living in a local forest comes, makes fun of the saint and abuses him for no reason.
Let us say a king fights with that man after finding out about this. Let us say that the
saint tells him to leave the man and yet the king punishes him.

The saint shows sattva  guna and he is not bothered by petty things.  He ignores the
abuse.  He  is  a  pure  person.  The  man  abusing  the  saint  for  no  reason  shows  tamo
guna, as he is in the dark. Abusing a saattwik person for no reason is a pathetic thing
to do and only a depraved person in darkness can do it. The king acts appropriatesly
and  shows  his  energy  by  defeating  the  man.  So  far  it  is  sattwa  guna  (the  state  of
being true). But the king punishes the man ignoring the advice of the saint to forgive
him. His passionate response makes him a person with rajo guna.

(1) Saattwik signs, i.e. signs with sattwa guna, are – Cn, Le, Sg, Pi.

(2) Raajasik signs, i.e. signs with rajo guna, are – Ar, Ta, Li, Sc.

(3) Taamasik signs, i.e. signs with tamo guna, are – Ge, Vi, Cp, Aq.

2.2.8  Rasis and Directions

(1) Ar, Le and Sg show east.

(2) Ta, Vi and Cp show south.

(3) Ge, Li and Aq show west.

(4) Cn, Sc and Pi show north.

2.2.9  Rasis and Colors

Ar  shows  blood-red  color.  Ta  shows  white.  Ge  shows  grass  green.  Cn  shows  pale
red. Le shows white. Virgo is variegated. Libra shows black. Scorpio shows reddish

Part 1: Chart Analysis

25

brown.  Sagittarius  shows  the  color  of  the  husk  of  grass.  Capricorn  is  variegated.
Aquarius shows brown color (that of a mongoose). Pisces shows cream color or the
the color of fish.

2.2.10  Day and Night

(1) Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Sg and Cp are night time rasis – they are strong during the night

time. They are nishaa rasis.

(2) Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Aq and Pi are daytime rasis – they are strong during the daytime.

They are divaa rasis.

Out  of  the  two  rasis  owned  by  a  planet,  one  is  a  day  sign  and  one  is  a  night  sign.
Moon governs all the nishaa rasis and Sun governs all the divaa rasis.

2.2.11  Rising of rasis

Some rasis rise with their head. They are called “Seershodaya rasis”. Some rasis rise
with their feet4. They are called “Prishthodaya rasis”.

(1) Ge, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Aq are Seershodaya rasis.

(2) Ar, Ta, Cn, Sg, Cp are Prishthodaya rasis.

(3) Pi rises with both its head and feet.

It is said that planets in Seershodaya rasis give their results in the first half of their
dasas and planets in Prishthodaya rasis  give their results in the second half of their
dasas.

2.2.12  Varna or Class

In  Hinduism,  people  are  divided  into  4  varnas  or  classes  –  (1)  Brahmanas,  (2)
Kshatriyas,  (3)  Vaisyas  and  (4)  Sudras.  Brahmanas  pursue  knowledge  and  work  as
priests or ministers. Kshatriyas are valiant and they become kings, army  chiefs and

4  Many  scholars  have  interpreted  “prishthodaya”  as  “rising  with  the  feet”.  So  we  will  use  the  same
interpretation. However, strictly speaking, one should note that “prishtha” means “back”.

  26

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

soldiers.  Vaisyas  are  the  traders  and  suppliers  of  various  services.  Sudras  execute
various menial tasks.

(1) Brahmanas (scholars) are represented by watery signs – Cn, Sc, Pi.

(2) Kshatriyas (warriors) are represented by by fiery signs – Ar, Le, Sg.

(3) Vaisyas (traders) are represented by by earthy signs – Ta, Vi, Cp.

(4) Sudras (workers) are represented by by airy signs – Ge, Li, Aq.

3.   Planets

3.1

Introduction

There are 7 grahas (planets) in Vedic astrology: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter,
Venus and Saturn. There are two more chaayaa grahas (shadow planets): Rahu and
Ketu.  Rahu  and  Ketu  are  mathematical  points.  They  are  also  called  the  north  and
south nodes or the head and tail of dragon. They are based on the points at which the
orbit of Moon around earth cuts the orbit of earth around Sun.

Rasis  represent  situations  that  develop  in  one’s  life  and  influences  that  enter  one’s
life. Planets in a chart represent human beings that play a role in one’s life.

Just  as  the  whole  zodiac  represents  Lord  Vishnu  and  rasis  represent  His  limbs,
planets represent Vishnu’s avataras (incarnations).

3.2  Characteristics of Planets

3.2.1  Vishnu’s Avataras

This world contains two essences – jeevaamsa (living essence) and paramaatmaamsa
(absolute and supreme essence). Planets are the manifestations of different aspects of
these  essences.  Vishnu’s  incarnations  happened  with  these  essences  taken  from
various planets.

Meena/Matsya avatara (fish) came from Ketu. Koorma avatara (tortoise) came from
Saturn.  Varaaha/sookara  avatara  (boar)  came  from  Rahu.  Narasimha/Nrisimha
avatara  (half-man,  half-lion)  came  from  Mars.  Vaamana  avatara  (learned  dwarf)
came  from  Jupiter.  Parasu  Rama/Bhaargava  Rama  came  from  Venus.  Rama  came
from Sun. Krishna came from Moon. Buddha came from Mercury.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

29

these

incarnations  came

All
into  being  with  a  significant  percentage  of
paramaatmaamsa  (supreme  essence)  than  jeevaatmaamsa  (living  essence).  Rama,
Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha avataras had only paramaatmaamsa.

Other living beings are born with a significant percentage of jeevaamsa and a little of
paramaatmaamsa from the planets.

3.2.2  Benefics and Malefics

(1) Jupiter  and  Venus  are  natural  benefics  (saumya  grahas  or  subha  grahas).
Mercury  becomes  a  natural  benefic  when  he  is  alone  or  with  more  natural
benefics. Waxing Moon of Sukla paksha is a natural benefic.

(2) Sun, Mars, Rahu and Ketu are natural malefics (kroora grahas or paapa grahas).
Mercury becomes a natural malefic when he is joined by more natural malefics.
Waning Moon of Krishna paksha is a natural malefic.

This information is important because the results given by planets are based on their
inherent nature.

3.2.3  Main Governance

Sun  governs  soul.  Moon  governs  mind.  Mars  governs  strength.  Mercury  governs
speech.  Jupiter  governs  knowledge  and  happiness.  Venus  governs  potency.  Saturn
governs grief.

3.2.4

Planets and Colors

Sun shows blood-red color. Moon shows tawny color. Mars shows blood-red color.
Mercury  shows  grass  green  color.  Jupiter  shows  tawny  color.  Venus  is  variegated.
Saturn shows black color.

These colors can be useful, for example, when predicting the color of one’s car. For
now, readers should just memorize these characteristics.

3.2.5

Planetary Cabinet

  30

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Sun  and  Moon  are  kings.  Mars  is  the  leader  (army  chief).  Mercury  is  the  prince.
Jupiter and  Venus  are the ministers. Saturn is the servant. Rahu and  Ketu form the
army.

3.2.6

Planetary Deities

Ruling deities of various planets are as given below: Agni (fire god) for Sun, Varuna
(rain  god)  for  Moon,  Subrahmanya  (army  chief  of  gods)  for  Mars,    Maha  Vishnu
(supreme sustaining force) for Mercury, Indra (ruler of gods) for Jupiter, Sachi Devi
(Indra’s wife) for Venus, Brahma (Creator) for Saturn.

3.2.7

Sex of Planets

Sun,  Mars  and  Jupiter  are  male.  Moon  and  Venus  are  female.  Saturn  and  Mercury
are female.

This information can be used for predicting the sex of children based on one’s chart.
For  example,  if  the  house  ruling  the  first  child  is  influenced  by  Jupiter,  Mars  and
Mercury,  we  may  predict  a  son.  If  it  is  influenced  by  Moon  and  Mercury,  we  may
predict a daughter.

3.2.8

Planets & Five Elements

(1) Agni tattva (fiery element) is ruled by Mars. Sun also has the same nature.
(2) Bhoo tattva (earthy element) is ruled by Mercury.
(3) Vaayu tattva (airy element) is ruled by Saturn.
(4) Aakaasa tattva (ethery element) is ruled by Jupiter.
(5) Jala tattva (watery element) is ruled by Venus. Moon also has the same nature.

These rulerships throw light on the basic nature of planets. Being a fiery planet, Mars
governs leadership, enterprise etc. Being an earthy planet, Mercury governs memory,
logical abilities etc. Being an airy planet, Saturn governs wandering and free spirit.
Being  a  watery  planet,  Venus  governs  imaginative  and  creative  work.  Being  an
ethery planet, Jupiter governs wisdom, intelligence and perceiving knowledge.

3.2.9

Planets & Varnas

Part 1: Chart Analysis

31

Jupiter and Venus are Brahmanas (learned). Sun and Mars are Kshatriyas (warriors).
Moon and Mercury are Vaisyas (traders). Saturn is a Sudra (worker).

Learning and intelligence is the forte of the learned class. Bravery is the forte of the
warrior  class.  Getting  along  with  others  well  is  the  forte  of  the  trader  class.  Hard
work is the forte of the working class. In this manner, we should understand varnas
to show one’s basic nature rather than the caste of one’s family.

It should be noted that Moon, who was earlier classified in the planetary cabinet as a
king, is said here to be of Vaisya varna. Sun is a king who is also a warrior. He is a
brave  king,  who  asserts  himself.  But  Moon  is  a  king  who  gets  along  well  with
everyone.

3.2.10  Planets & Gunas

Sun, Moon and Jupiter are saattwik planets. Mercury and Venus are raajasik planets.
Mars and Saturn are taamasik planets.

NOTE:  There  is  a  misconception  today  that  sattwa  guna  means  patience  and  not
hurting others. An aggressive response to an offender is often thought to be raajasik.
However,  sattwa  simply  means  “the  state  of  being  true”.  Pleasing  others  with
artificial  goodness  is  not  sattwa  guna.  Punishing  a  person  for  his  mistakes  is  not
necessarily  rajo  guna.  If  there  is  some  passion  and  impurity  in  one’s  energetic
response, then it shows  rajo guna.  But, if a  warrior fights a sinning person with no
passion or ego, it can still be a saattvic act. Lord Sri Rama and Sun are examples for
this. Sun is a king of the warrior class and yet he is saattwik. Lord Rama, who was
born with his amsa, is a saattwik person despite killing Ravana and other demons.

Sattva guna simply means purity and truthfulness in one’s thoughts and action. Rajo
guna shows some passion, energy and impurity in thoughts and actions. Tamo guna
shows a dark, mean and depraved spirit in thoughts and actions.

3.2.11  Planetary Abodes

Sun  lives  in  a  temple.  Moon  lives  in  a  watery  place.  Mercury  lives  in  a  sports
ground. Jupiter lives in a treasure house. Venus lives in the bedroom. Saturn lives in
a filthy area.

  32

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

This description should give one an idea of the nature of planets.

3.2.12  Seven Dhaatus

Sapta  dhaatus  or  7  matters  make  up  human  body.  The  planetary  rulerships  are  as
follows: Sun rules bones. Moon rules blood. Mars rules marrow. Mercury rules skin.
Jupiter  rules  fat.  Venus  rules  semen  (materials  related  to  the  reproductive  system).
Saturn rules muscles.

If Sun is afflicted, it can show some problems related to bones. Weakness of Moon
may give blood related problems. And so on.

3.2.13  Planets & Time Periods

Sun rules an ayana5. Moon rules a minute. Mars rules a week. Mercury rules a ritu6.
Jupiter rules a month. Venus rules a fortnight. Saturn rules a year.

These periods are very useful in prasna or horary astrology.

3.2.14  Planets & Tastes

Sun governs the pungent taste (e.g. onion, ginger, pepper). Moon governs the saline
taste (e.g. sea salt, rock salt). Mars governs the bitter taste (e.g. karela/bitter melon,
dandelion  root,  rhubarb  root,  neem  leaves).  Mercury  governs  a  mixed  taste.  Jupiter
governs  sweetness  (e.g.  sugar,  dates).  Venus  governs  the  sour  taste  (e.g.  lemon,
tamarind). Saturn governs the astringent taste (e.g. plantain, pomegranate).

The 2nd house shows one’s preference in food. The planets influencing it may decide
one’s  favorite  taste.  In  addition,  one  should  avoid  the  tastes  of  the  planets  who  are
likely bring disease. Suppose one is running a dasa or antardasa of a sign containing
Moon as per Shoola dasa (a dasa that shows suffering). Then some suffering related
to Moon is possible. Moon can give problems related to blood pressure as he governs

5  There  are  2  ayanas  in  a  year.  During  Sun’s  transit  from  Cp  to  Ge,  we  have  Uttara  (north)  ayana.
During Sun’s transit from Cn to Sg, we have Dakshina (south) ayana.
6 Ritu roughly means a “season”. There are 6 ritus in a year. They are – vasanta (spring), greeshma
(summer), varsha (rain), hemanta (dew), seeta (winter), sisira (fall). Each ritu consists of 2 months.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

33

blood. So eating too much salty food during such a period may result in high blood
pressure. Similarly, one should cut down on sweets during a period in which Jupiter
related  troubles  are  indicated.  Or,  one  may  develop  too  much  fat  (Jupiter)  or  get
other Jupiter related diseases.

3.2.15  Planetary Strengths

Mercury  and  Jupiter  are  strong  in  the  eastern  direction  (lagna).  Sun  and  Mars  are
strong in the southern direction (meridian – 10th house). Moon and Venus are strong
in the northern direction (nadir – 4th house). Saturn is strong in the west (7th house).
These  are  the  digbalas  (strengths  associated  with  direction)  of  planets.  These  show
the direction taken by one in one’s life, as we will see later.

Moon,  Mars  and  Saturn  are  strong  in  the  night  time.  Sun,  Jupiter  and  Venus  are
strong in the daytime. Mercury is always strong.

Natural malefics are strong in Krishna paksha. Natural benefics are strong in Sukla
paksha.

Natural malefics are strong in Dakshina ayana7. Natural benefics are strong in Uttara
ayana.

3.2.16  Planets & Ritus

Planetary rulerships over ritus (seasons) are as  follows: Venus governs vasanta ritu
(spring).  Mars  governs  greeshma  ritu  (summer).  Moon  governs  varsha  ritu  (rainy
season).  Mercury  governs  hemanta  ritu  (season  of  dew).  Jupiter  governs  seeta  ritu
(winter). Saturn governs sisira ritu (fall).

3.2.17  Dhatu, Moola and Jeeva

(1) Rahu, Mars, Saturn and Moon rule over dhaatus (metals and materials).

(2) Sun and Venus rule over moolas (roots and vegetables).

(3) Mercury, Jupiter and Ketu rule over jeevas (living beings).

3.3  Planetary Dignities

Each  planet  has  a  sign  where  it  is  exalted  (uchcha),  a  sign  where  it  is  debilitated
(neecha), a sign that is called its moolatrikona and one or two rasis that are owned by
it. A planet is said to be strong in its own rasi or exaltation rasi or moolatrikona.

Table 6 shows own rasis, exaltation rasis, the degree of deep exaltation, debilitation
rasi, the degree of deep debilitation and the moolatrikona of each planet.

Some special points regarding the results given by planets:

(1) Sun  gives  the  results  of  being  in  moolatrikona  in  the  first  20º  of  Le  and  the

results of being in own rasi in the remaining 10º.

(2) Moon  gives  the  results  of  being  in  exaltation  rasi  in  the  first  3º  of  Ta  and  the

results of being in moolatrikona in the remaining 27º.

(3) Mars  gives  the  results  of  being  in  moolatrikona  in  the  first  12º  of  Le  and  the

results of being in own rasi in the remaining 18º.

(4) Mercury  gives  the  results  of  being  in  exaltation  rasi  in  the  first  15º  of  Vi,  the
results of being in moolatrikona in the next 5º and the results of being in own rasi
in the remaining 10º.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

(5) Jupiter  gives  the  results  of  being  in  moolatrikona  in  the  first  10º  of  Sg  and  the

results of being in own rasi in the remaining 20º.

(6) Venus  gives  the  results  of  being  in  moolatrikona  in  the  first  half  of  Li  and  the

results of being in own rasi in the second half of Li.

(7) Saturn  gives  the  results  of  being  in  moolatrikona  in  the  first  20º  of  Aq  and  the

results of being in own rasi in the remaining 10º.

An  analogy  may  help  one  understand  the  subtle  difference  between  own  rasi,
exaltation rasi and moolatrikona.

Own rasi of a planet (e.g. Pisces of Jupiter) is like one’s home. One is most natural
and comfortable at home. That is exactly what a planet in own rasi is. Moolatrikona
of a planet (e.g. Sagittarius of Jupiter) is like one’s office. One executes one’s formal
job  and  performs  one’s  duty  at  office.  One  is  powerful  and  duty-minded  at  office.
Exaltation sign of a planet (e.g. Cancer of Jupiter) is like a favorite party/picnic. One
is excited to be at one’s favorite party/picnic. So an exalted planet is like an excited
person  at  his  favorite  picnic  spot.  Debilitation  sign  of  a  planet  (e.g.  Capricorn  of
Jupiter) is like one’s worst party. A debilitated planet is like an unhappy person stuck
at a place he hates.

Jupiter  is  a  saattwik  and  dharmik  Brahmin.  Ethery  Jupiter,  planet  of  perception,
intelligence  and  wisdom,  is  most  comfortable  in  saattwik  Pisces,  which  is  the  12th
house  of  the  natural  zodiac.  That  is  his  home.  However,  he  also  has  to  uphold
dharma. Upholding dharma is his duty. Whether he likes it or not, he has to do it. So
fiery Sagittarius, 9th house in the natural zodiac, is his moolatrikona. Jupiter is like a
"raaja purohit" (chief priest of a king) in Sagittarius. He has to sometimes take strong
decisions to uphold dharma (like sentencing someone to death). In Pisces, he is like a
peaceful  Brahmin  doing  pooja  at  his  home.  In  watery  Cancer,  the  4th  house  of  the
natural zodiac, Jupiter is excited to do some imaginative (watery) learning (4th house
matter).  In  taamasik  and  earthy  Capricorn,  the  10th  house  of  the  natural  zodiac,
Jupiter hates doing tamasik and well-defined karma (action, 10th house matter). It is
against  his  nature.  Executing  well-defined  taamasik  karma  may  be  fine  with
taamasik  planets  Mars  and  Saturn,  but  Jupiter  is  unhappy  with  it.  So  Jupiter  is
debilitated in Cp.

  36

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Take  Mercury  as  another  example.  He  is  an  intellectual  planet  and  significator  of
communications.  “Intelligent  communication”  is  the  most  comfortable  activity  for
him.  So  his  home  is  intellectual  Gemini,  the  3rd  house  (communications)  of  the
natural  zodiac.  However,  intelligent  debates  and  arguments  are  the  formal  job
assigned  to  him.  Virgo  is  the  6th  house  (arguments)  of  the  natural  zodiac  and  it  is
Mercury’s moolatrikona!

While  saattwik  and  ethery  Jupiter  doesn't  quite  love  the  job  of  fiercely  and  fierily
upholding dharma (by punishing demon king Bali in Vaamana avatara, for example),
he does it with a sense of duty. But Mercury loves his official job! He loves engaging
in  intellectual  debates.  So  Virgo  (6th  house  of  the  natural  zodiac)  is  not  only  his
moolatrikona  (office),  but  also  his  exaltation  sign  (favorite  picnic  spot).  Still,
"intelligent communications" (Gemini) is what he is most comfortable with (home).

Let us take one final example – Ketu. Ketu is most comfortable with occult activity,
which are shown by the 8th house. So he owns the 8th house of the natural zodiac, i.e.
Scorpio.  His  official  duty,  however,  is  giving  upaasana  (meditation)  and  moksha
(liberation),  which  are  shown  by  the  12th  house.  So  his  moolatrikona  is  in  the  12th
house of the natural zodiac, i.e. Pisces.

One  should  remember  the  above  and  understand  the  mood  of  a  planet  based  on
whether it is in own rasi or exaltation rasi or moolatrikona. Though all the three are
good placements, there is a subtle difference in the mood of the planet and the results
given by it.

3.4  Planetary Relationships

3.4.1  Natural Relationships

For each planet, its friends and enemies are found as follows: Take the moolatrikona
of the planet. Lord of the rasi where it is exalted is its friend. Lords of 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th,
9th and 12th rasis from it are also its natural friends. Lords of other rasis are its natural
enemies. If a planet becomes a friend and an enemy on account of owning two rasis,
then  it  is  a  neutral  planet.  The  list  of  friends,  neutral  planets  and  enemies  of  all
planets is listed in Table 7.

3.4.2

Temporary Relationships

In addition to the permanent relationship, we have temporary relationships based on
the  planetary  position  in  a  chart.  These  temporary  (tatkaala)  relationships  are
specific to a chart.

Planets  occupying  the  2nd,  3rd,  4th,  10th,  11th  and  12th  rasis  counted  from  the  rasi
occupied  by  a  planet  are  its  temporary  friends.  Planet  occupying  other  rasis  are  its
temporary enemies.

Example 4: Let us consider Lord Sree Rama’s chart given in Figure 1 and find the
temporary friends and temporary enemies of Sun and Moon.

Sun: Sun is in Ar. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted from Ar are Ta,
Ge, Cn, Cp, Aq and Pi. Planets in those rasis are Mercury, Moon, Jupiter, Mars and
Venus. They are temporary friends of Sun in this chart. Saturn is the only temporary
enemy.

Moon: Moon is in Cn. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted from Cn are
Le, Vi, Li, Ar, Ta and Ge. Planets in those rasis are Saturn, Sun and Mercury. They
are  temporary  friends  of  Moon  in  this  chart.  Temporary  enemies  are  Mars,  Jupiter,
Venus.

  38

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Exercise  5:  Consider  Lord  Sree  Rama’s  chart  given  in  Figure  1  and  find  the
temporary friends and temporary enemies of Jupiter and Venus.

Note that Moon and Jupiter have the same temporary friends and temporary enemies.
That is because they occupy the same rasi and temporary relationships are based on
the rasis occupied by planets.

3.4.3  Compound Relationships

We  get  the  compound  relationships  between  planets  by  combining  permanent  and
temporary relationships as shown in Table 8.

Natural friend
Natural neutral
Natural enemy

Table 8: Compound Relationships
Temporary friend
Adhimitra (good friend)
Mitra (friend)
Sama (neutral)

Temporary enemy
Sama (neutral)
Satru (enemy)
Adhisatru (bad enemy)

Example 5: Let us continue from Example 4 and find the friends and enemies of Sun
and Moon in Lord Sree Rama’s chart given in Figure 1.

Sun:  We  found  in  Example  4  that  Sun’s  temporary  friends  are  Mercury,  Moon,
Jupiter,  Mars  and  Venus.  Of  these,  Moon,  Mars and  Jupiter  are  natural  friends  and
they  become  adhimitras  (good  friends).  Mercury  is  a  neutral  planet  in  natural
relationship  and  he  becomes  a  mitra  (friend)  in  compound  relationship.  Venus  is  a
natural enemy. Being a temporary friend, Venus becomes a sama (neutral) planet in
compound relationship.

Saturn is the only temporary enemy of Sun. Being a natural enemy too, he becomes
an adhisatru (bad enemy) of Sun.

Moon: We found in Example 4 that Moon’s temporary friends are Sun, Mercury and
Saturn.  Of  these,  Sun  and  Mercury  are  natural  friends  and  they  become  adhimitras
(good  friends).  Saturn  is  a  neutral  in  natural  relationship  and  he  becomes  a  mitra
(friend) in compound relationship.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

39

Moon’s  temporary  enemies  are  Mars,  Jupiter  and  Venus.  They  are  all  natural
neutrals and they become satru (enemies) in compound relationship.

Exercise  6:  Continue  from  Exercise  5  and  find  the  friends  and  enemies  of  Jupiter
and Venus in Lord Sree Rama’s chart given in Figure 1.

Whenever we refer to a planet being in a friendly house or an inimical house in the
rest  of  this  book,  we  mean  the  compound  relationships.  A  planet  occupying  a  rasi
owned  by  a  mitra  or  adhimitra  is  in  a  friendly  house.  A  planet  occupying  a  rasi
owned by a satru or adhisatru is in an inimical house.

3.5  Answers to Exercises

Exercise 5:

Jupiter: Jupiter is in Cn. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted from Cn are
Le, Vi, Li, Ar, Ta and Ge. Planets in those rasis are Saturn, Sun and Mercury. They
are  temporary  friends  of  Jupiter  in  this  chart.  Temporary  enemies  are  Moon,  Mars,
Venus.

Venus: Venus is in Pi. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th rasis counted from Pi are
Ar, Ta, Ge, Sg, Cp and Aq. Planets in those rasis are Sun, Mercury and Mars. They
are temporary friends of Venus in this chart. Temporary enemies are Moon, Jupiter,
Saturn.

Exercise 6:

Jupiter:  We  found  in  Exercise  5  that  the  temporary  friends  of  Jupiter  are  Sun,
Mercury and Saturn. Being a natural friend, Sun becomes an adhimitra (good friend).
Being  a  natural  neutral,  Saturn  becomes  a  mitra  (friend).  Being  a  natural  enemy,
Mercury becomes a neutral planet in compound relationship.

Temporary enemies of Jupiter are Moon, Mars and Venus. Being natural friends of
Jupiter,  Moon  and  Mars  become  sama  (neutral)  planets  in  compound  relationship.
Being  a  neutral  planet  in  natural  relationship,  Venus  becomes  an  enemy  in
compound relationship.

  40

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Venus:  We  found  in  Exercise  5  that  the  temporary  friends  of  Venus  are  Sun,  Mars
and  Mercury.  Being  a  natural  friend,  Mercury  becomes  an  adhimitra  (good  friend).
Being a neutral planet in natural relationship, Mars becomes a mitra (friend). Being
an  enemy  in  natural  relationship,  Sun  becomes  a  sama  (neutral)  in  compound
relationship.

Temporary enemies of Venus are Moon, Jupiter, Saturn. Of these, Saturn is a natural
friend and he becomes a sama (neutral) in compound relationship. Jupiter is a natural
neutral and he becomes a satru (enemy) of Venus in compound relationship. Moon is
a  natural  enemy  of  Venus  and  he  becomes  an  adhisatru  (bad  enemy)  in  compound
relationship.

4.   Upagrahas

4.1

Introduction

There are 11 upagrahas (sub-planets or satellites) defined by Sage Parasara. They do
not  appear  to  correspond  to  any  physical  bodies  (planets,  stars  etc).  From  Sage
Parasara's  definition,  they  appear  to  be  some  significant  mathematical  points.  They
will be defined in two groups.

4.2  Sun-based Upagrahas

Five upagrahas called Dhuma, Vyatipaata, Parivesha, Indrachaapa and Upaketu
are defined based on Sun's longitude. The  exact  formulas are  given in Table 9. All
these  upagrahas  are  very  malefic  in  nature.  Any  houses  occupied  by  them  in  rasi
chart or divisional charts are spoiled by them.

Table 9: Sun-based Upagrahas

Upagraha
Dhuma
Vyatipaata
Parivesha
Indrachaapa

Upaketu

Longitude Formula
Sun's longitude + 133°20'
360º – Dhuma’s longitude
Vyatipata's longitude + 180°
360º – Parivesha’s longitude
Indrachaapa’s longitude + 16°40'
= Sun's longitude – 30°

It may be noted that Dhuma and Indrachaapa are apart by 180° and Vyatipaata and
Parivesha are apart by 180°.

Example 6:
Let us say Sun is at 9Sg36. Sg is the 9th rasi and so Sun's longitude can be expressed
as 8s 9°36' (based on the notation introduced in 1.3.2). The length of each of the 8

  42

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

rasis before Sg is 30°. So we can find the longitude of Sun (i.e., distance traversed by
Sun from the beginning of the zodiac) as 8x30°+9°36' = 249°36'.

Adding  133°20'  to  it,  we  get  382°56'.  This  can  be  rewritten8  as  22°56'.  That  is  the
longitude of Dhuma. So Dhuma is at 22°56' in Ar. Because Dhuma and Indrachaapa
are 180° apart, you can say without further computation that Indrachapa is in the 7th
sign from Ar, which is Li. His advancement from the start of Li is also 22°56'.

NOTE:  You  can  verify  that  Aries  and  Libra,  Taurus  and  Scorpio,  Gemini  and
Sagittarius, Cancer and Capricorn, Leo and Aquarius, Virgo and Pisces are the signs
that are 180° apart. So, if Dhuma is at 11°36' from the start of Aquarius, Indrachapa
will be at 11°36' from the start of Leo.

Vyatipata is obtained by subtracting Dhuma from 360º. We see that 360º – 22°56' =
337°4'. So Vyatipata is at 337°4', i.e. at 7°4' from the start of Pi. Since Parivesha is at
180º from Vyatipata, he is at 7°4' in Vi.

Exercise 7: If Sun is at 13°19' from the start of Ta, find the positions of all the five
upagrahas defined so far.

4.3  Other Upagrahas

Six upagrahas called Kaala, Mrityu, Arthaprahaara, Yamaghantaka, Gulika and
Maandi are more difficult to compute. Kaala is  a malefic upagraha similar to Sun.
Mrityu  is  a  malefic  upagraha  similar  to  Mars.  Arthaprahaara  is  similar  to  Mercury.
Yamaghantaka is similar to Jupiter. Gulika and Maandi are similar to Saturn.

A day starts at the time of sunrise and ends at the time of sunset. A night starts at the
time of sunset and ends at the time of next day’s sunrise. Depending on whether one
is born during the day or the night, we divide the length of the day/night into 8 equal
parts.

8 When adding or subtracting longitudes, we should subtract 360° if we get more than 360° and we
should  add  360°  if  we  get  less  than  0°.  Adding  or  subtracting  360°  means  going  around  the  zodiac
once and coming to the same position. We should finally reduce all longitudes to a value between 0°
and 360°, by adding or subtracting 360° as many times as needed.

Daytime  births:  The  first  part  is  ruled  by  the  lord  of  weekday  and  then  we  cover
planets in the order of weekdays. The part after the one ruled by Saturn is lord-less.
After  that,  Sun’s  part  comes.  For  example,  the  first  1/8th  of  the  daytime  on  a
Thursday  is  ruled  by  Jupiter.  Next  part  is  ruled  by  Venus.  The  3rd  part  is  ruled  by
Saturn. The 4th part is lord-less. The 5th part is ruled by Sun. The 6th part is ruled by
Moon. The 7th planet is ruled by Mars. The 8th part is ruled by Mercury.

Night time births: The first part is ruled by the 5th planet from the lord of weekday
and then we cover planets in the order of weekdays. For example, the first 1/8th of a
Thursday  night  is  ruled  by  the  5th  planet  from  Jupiter,  i.e.  Moon  (Jupiter,  Venus,
Saturn, Sun, Moon – that’s the 5th one). Next part is ruled by Mars. The  3rd part is
ruled by Mercury. The 4th part is ruled by Jupiter. The 5th part is ruled by Venus. The
6th part is ruled by Saturn. The 7th planet is lord-less. The 8th part is ruled by Sun.

Table 10 gives the list of the ruling planets of all the eight parts of the daytime and
night time on all weekdays.

  44

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Once  we  divide  the  day/night  of  birth  into  8  equal  parts  and  identify  the  ruling
planets  of  the  8  parts,  we  can  find  the  longitudes  of  Kaala  etc  upagrahas  using  the
following procedure:

(1)  Kaala rises at the middle of Sun’s part9. In other words, we find the time at the
middle of Sun’s part and find lagna rising then. That gives Kaala’s longitude.

(2)  Mrityu rises at the middle of Mars’s part.
(3)  Artha Praharaka rises at the middle of Mercury’s part.
(4)  Yama Ghantaka rises at the middle of Jupiter’s part.
(5)  Gulika rises at the middle of Saturn’s part.
(6)  Maandi rises at the beginning of Saturn’s part.

Suppose  one  is  born  on  Thursday  night  and  we  want  Yamaghantaka’s  longitude  in
his chart. Suppose night starts at 6 pm and ends at 6 am on the next day. We see from
the  table  that  Jupiter  rules  the  4th  part  of  a  Thursday  night.  Each  part  is  12/8  =  1.5
hours. The 4th part starts 4.5 hours after sunset, i.e. at 10:30 pm, and ends 1.5 hours
later. So Jupiter’s part extends from 10:30 pm to midnight. The middle point of this
part  is  at  11:15  pm.  We  find  lagna  rising  at  11:15  pm  and  that  will  be  Yama
Ghantaka’s longitude.

9  Some  scholars  suggest  that  Kaala  rises  at  the  beginning  of  Sun’s  part.  The  same  thing  applies  to
others.

5.   Special Lagnas

5.1

Introduction

There are some special lagnas defined by Parasara. In this book, we will widely use
Hora lagna and Ghati lagna and it is time to define them and other special lagnas.

5.2  Bhaava Lagna

Bhaava lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of sunrise. It moves at the rate of
one rasi per 2 hours. In the rest of this book, bhava lagna will be denoted by BL.10

If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4°47' then, horalagna is at 6s 4°47'
at 6:00 am, at 6s 19°47' at 7:00 am, at 7s 4°47' at 8:00 am, 8s 4°47' at 10:00 am and
so on. Bhavalagna moves at the rate of 1° per 4 minutes (i.e., 15° per hour).

The following method may be used for computing bhavalagna.

(1) Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise.
(2) Find the difference between the birthtime (or the event time) and the sunrise time
found  in  (1)  above.  Convert  the  difference  into  minutes.  The  result  is  the
advancement of bhavalagna since sunrise, in degrees.

(3) Add  Sun's  longitude  at  sunrise  (in  degrees)  to  the  above  number.  Expunge

multiples of 360° and reduce the number to the range 0°–360°.

(4) This is the longitude of bhavalagna (BL).

Example 7:
A  gentleman  was  born  at  7:23  pm. Sunrise  at  his  birthplace  was  at  6:37  am  on  his
birthday. At 6:37 am, Sun was at 24°17' in Capricorn. Let us find BL.

(1) 19:23–6:37=12 hr 46 min=12x60 + 46 min = 766 min

10 BL is defined only for the sake of completeness. We will not use it in this book.

  46

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(2) Sun's longitude at sunrise is 270°+24°17'=294°17'. Add 766° to it. The result is
1060°17'. Subtracting 360° twice, we get 340°17'. So BL is at 10°17' in Pisces.

5.3  Hora Lagna

Hora lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of sunrise. It moves at the rate of one
rasi per hora (hour). In the rest of this book, horalagna will be denoted by HL.

If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4°47' then, horalagna is at 6s 4°47'
at 6:00 am, at 6s 19°47' at 6:30 am, at 7s 4°47' at 7:00 am, 8s 4°47' at 8:00 am and so
on. Horalagna moves at the rate of 1/2° per minute (i.e., 30° per hour).

The following method may be used for computing horalagna.

(1) Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise.
(2) Find the difference between the birthtime (or the event time) and the sunrise time

found in (1) above. Convert the difference into minutes.

(3) Divide  the  number  by  2.  The  result  is  the  advancement  of  horalagna  since

sunrise, in degrees.

(4) Add  Sun's  longitude  at  sunrise  (in  degrees)  to  the  above  number.  Expunge

multiples of 360° and reduce the number to the range 0°–360°.

(5) This is the longitude of horalagna (HL).

Example 8:
A  gentleman  was  born  at  7:23  pm. Sunrise  at  his  birthplace  was  at  6:37  am  on  his
birthday. At 6:37 am, Sun was at 24°17' in Capricorn. Let us find HL.

(1) 19:23–6:37=12 hr 46 min=12x60 + 46 min = 766 min
(2) 766/2=383
(3) Sun's longitude at sunrise is 270°+24°17'=294°17'. Add 383° to it. The result is

677°17'. Subtracting 360°, we get 317°17'. So HL is at 17°17' in Aquarius.

5.4  Ghati Lagna

Part 1: Chart Analysis

47

Ghati lagna is at the position of Sun at the time of sunrise. It moves at the rate of one
rasi  per  ghati  (ghati=1/60th  of  a  day,  i.e.,  24  minutes).  In  the  rest  of  this  book,
ghatilagna will be denoted by GL. Ghati lagna is also called “ghatika lagna”.

If sunrise takes place at 6:00 am and Sun is at 6s 4°47' then, ghatilagna is at 6s 4°47'
at 6:00 am, at 6s 19°47' at 6:12 am, at 7s 4°47' at 6:24 am, 8s 4°47' at 6:48 am and so
on. Ghatilagna moves at the rate of 1°15' per minute (i.e., 30° per 24 minutes).

The following method may be used for computing ghatilagna.

(1) Find the time of sunrise and sun's longitude at sunrise.
(2) Find the difference between the birthtime (or the event time) and the sunrise time

found in (1) above. Convert the difference into minutes.

(3) Multiply the number by 5. Divide the result by 4. The result is the advancement

of ghatilagna since sunrise, in degrees.

(4) Add  Sun's  longitude  at  sunrise  (in  degrees)  to  the  above  number.  Expunge

multiples of 360° and reduce the number to the range 0°–360°.

(5) This is the longitude of ghatilagna (GL).

Example 9:
Let us find GL for the data in Example 8.

(1) 19:23–6:37=12 hr 46 min=766 min
(2) 766x5/4=957.5
(3) Sun's  longitude  at  sunrise  is  294°17'.  Add  957°30'  to  it.  The  result  is  1251°47'.

Subtracting 360° three times, we get 171°47'. So GL is at 21°47' in Virgo.

Exercise 8:
A lady was born at 3:11:48 am (hr, min, sec) in the early hours of May 28, 1961. Sun
was  at  13°1'  in  Taurus  then.  Sunrise  was  at  6:19:18  am  on  May  27,  1961  at  her
birthplace. At that time, Sun was at 12°11' in Taurus. Find the longitudes of HL and
GL in her chart.

5.5  Comments

  48

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(1)  If  the  birthtime  changes  by  one  minute,  GL  will  change  by  1.25°  (i.e.,  1°15').
This  is  quite  large  and  it  can  cause  some  error  in  the  position  of  GL  in  some
divisional  charts.  So,  ghati  lagna  is  more  sensitive  to  birthtime  errors  than
normal lagna. When using GL in divisional charts, we should keep this in mind
and  try  to  correct  the  birthtime  based  on  known  events  first.  Wrong  data
produces wrong results. Our analysis can only be as good as our data!

(2)  Some astrologers don't like dealing with it, but birthtime errors are a fact of life
and we have to live with them. If we prefer to choose methods that work in spite
of deviation in birthtime by a few minutes, we are ignoring a key fact – there are
many people in this world who are born a few minutes apart in nearby places and
yet  lead  significantly  different  lives.  Still  some  people  hide  from  this  fact  and
stick  to  methods  that  give  the  same  results  to  everyone  born  in  a  15-minute  or
one-hour  or  two-hour  period,  because  they  don't  have  to  deal  with  the
complicated issue of birthtime errors then! But that's not the right approach – we
should  give  importance  to  finer  techniques.  After  all,  Sage  Parasara  must  have
written about all these fine techniques only because he thought they were useful.

(3)  Some  people  define  sunrise  as  the  time  when  the  center  of  the  visual  disk
representing Sun rises on the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when lagna and Sun
are exactly at the same longitude. Some other people consider sunrise as the time
when the upper tip of the visual disk  representing Sun appears to be rising on
the  eastern  horizon,  i.e.,  the  time  when  the  first  ray  of  Sun  is  seen.  The  latter
approach is recommended.

Exercise 9:
Suppose (just suppose) that a key event from the known past of the lady of Exercise
8 makes us think that her GL has to be between 16°15' and 17°30' in Virgo. Correct
the given birthtime accordingly.

5.6  Use of Special Lagnas

Use of special lagnas will become clearer in future chapters. For now, it will suffice
to say that hora lagna shows money and ghati lagna shows power.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

49

In any chart, normal lagna shows self. Hora lagna shows self, from the point of view
of money, wealth and prosperity. Ghati lagna shows self, from the point of view of
fame, power and authority. For example, when we time good and bad periods for a
businessman,  hora  lagna  may  be  very  important.  When  we  time  good  and  bad
periods for a politician, ghati lagna may be very important.

5.7  Sree Lagna

In  Sanskrit,  the  word  “Sree”  means  wealth.  It  also  means  Lakshmi,  wife  of  Lord
Narayana and goddess of wealth. Sree Lagna will be denoted by SL in the rest of this
book. Sree Lagna is important for prosperity. Its use will be shown in the chapter on
Sudasa. Computation of Sree Lagna will be explained for now.

(1) Find the constellation occupied by Moon.

(2) Find the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon.

(3) Find the same fraction of the zodiac (360°).

(4) Add  this  amount  to  the  longitude  of  lagna.  Subtract  multiples  of  360°  if

necessary. The resulting amount is the longitude of Sree Lagna (SL).

Example 10:
Let us take a native with Moon at 13 Li 06 and lagna at 25 Vi 05. Moon’s longitude
is 180° + 13°6' = 193°6'. Lagna’s longitude 150°+25°5' is 175°5'.

(1) Moon is in Swathi constellation, which runs from 6°40' to 20°0' in Libra.

(2) Moon’s advancement in his constellation is 13°6' – 6°40' = 6°26'. As fraction of

the whole constellation, this is (6°26')/(13°20') = 386'/800' = 0.4825.

(3) The same fraction of the zodiac is 0.4825 x 360° = 173.7° = 173°42'.

(4) Adding this amount to the longitude of lagna, we get 175°5' + 173°42' = 348°47.

This is the longitude of SL. So SL is in Pisces at 18°47'.

  50

Exercise 10:
Suppose someone has Moon at 15 Le 29 and lagna at 14 Sc 19. Find the longitude of
SL (Sree Lagna).

Warning:  There  are  some  more  special  lagnas  defined  by  Parasara,  but  they  are
beyond the scope of this book. We will restrict ourselves to the ones defined in this
book.

Exercise 8:

HL: 8°26' in Aquarius.
GL: 17°48.5' in Virgo.

Exercise 9:

Birthtime has to be between 3:10:33 – 3:11:33 am.

[HINT:  GL  with  given  birthtime  (3:11:48  am)  is  at  17°48.5'  in  Virgo.  The  error  is
between 18.5' and 1°33.5', i.e., 0.3083° and 1.5583°. Find the corresponding error in
birthtime  in  minutes  and  convert  it  to  seconds.  Then  subtract  the  error  from
birthtime.]

6.   Divisional Charts

6.1  Divisions of A Rasi

Each  rasi  has  many  divisions.  Divisions  of  rasis  are  again  mapped  to  rasis.  For
example,  a  rasi  may  be  divided  into  4  parts  and  each  part  may  be  mapped  to  a
different rasi. Ar may be divided into 4 parts and the 4 parts may be mapped to Ar,
Cn, Li and Cp. Then the 4 parts of Ta may be mapped to Ta, Le, Sc and Aq. And so
on.  Like  this,  we  may  divide  all  rasis  into  4  parts  and  map  the  4  parts  to  different
rasis. We may also divide rasis to 9 parts and map each part into a rasi. We can have
many different divisions.

Sage  Parasara    defined  16  different  divisions  of  rasis.  Jaimini  and  Tajaka  writers
mentioned  4  more  divisions.  It  is  possible  that  Parasara  also  dealt  with  these  4
special  divisions  in  sections  that  are  perhaps  missing  today.  In  addition,  there  are
more higher and finer divisions that are normally not used.

Based  on  the  rasis  occupied  by  planets  in  various  divisions,  “divisional  charts”  are
drawn.    As  we  have  seen  before,  we  need  to  know  the  rasis  occupied  by  planets,
upagrahas, lagna and special lagnas to draw any chart. In every division, we divide
the  rasi  into  different  parts,  find  the  part  containing  each  planet  and  see  the  rasi  to
which  that  part  is  mapped.  Then  we  place  the  planet  in  that  rasi  in  the  chart
corresponding to that division. We can draw a chart for each division. A planet can
occupy different rasis in different divisions.

Chart  of  each  division  is  called  a  divisional  chart.  Each  divisional  chart  can  be
treated  as  a  different  chart  and  interpreted  differently.  Different  aspects  of  life  are
seen  in  different  divisional  charts.  Rasi  chart  is  simply  a  special  case  of  divisional
charts. If we divide each rasi into just one part (i.e. in effect, no division), we get rasi
chart.

In  the  rest  of  this  book,  everything  we  describe  will  be  applicable  to  all  divisional
charts,  unless  we  explicitly  state  a  chart.  We  can  apply  all  the  principles  to  all  the
divisional charts, but we should see only specific matters in a divisional chart. The

  52

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

list  of  matters  to  be  seen  in  each  divisional  chart  will  be  given  after  the  details  of
computation are presented.

In this book, D-n will denote the divisional chart based on the nth division of rasis,
i.e. based on dividing rasis into n parts.

6.2  Computing Divisional Charts

We  will  explain  the  computation  of  20  divisional  charts  in  this  section.  Higher
divisional  charts  like  D-108  and  D-150  and  variations  in  charts  like  D-2,  D-3,  D-8
and D-11 will not be covered in this book.

6.2.1  Rasi Chart (D-1)

A simple example of divisions is rasi chart itself. It is also called “kshetra chakra".
It is denoted by D-1. Longitudes in the range 0°-30° are mapped to Aries, 30°-60° to
Taurus and so on, as mentioned earlier. Using Table 1, we can find the rasi occupied
by a body based on its longitude. By “body” here, we mean planets, upagrahas, lagna
or special lagnas – basically a physical or a mathematical point in the zodiac that has
a longitude associated with it.

6.2.2  Hora Chart (D-2)

Each rasi is divided into 2 equal parts of 15° each. Bodies in the first 15° of odd rasis
are in Sun’s hora. Bodies in the second 15° of odd rasis are in Moon’s hora. Bodies
in the first 15° of even rasis are in Moon’s hora. Bodies in the second 15° of even
rasis are in Sun’s hora.

NOTE: Though absolutely correct, the above is not quite complete. Proper use of hora
chart  is beyond the scope of this book. So we will ignore and not use hora chart in
this book.

6.2.3  Drekkana Chart (D-3)

Part 1: Chart Analysis

53

Each rasi is divided into 3 equal parts of 10° each. Bodies in the first 10° of a rasi are
placed  in  drekkana  chart  in  the  same  rasi.  Bodies  in  the  middle  10°  of  a  rasi  are
placed in drekkana chart in the 5th from the rasi.  Bodies in the last 10° of a rasi are
placed in drekkana chart in the 9th from the rasi.

Example 11: Let us say Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are together in Gemini in rasi
chart. Mercury is at 3°. Jupiter is at 19°. Venus is at 21°.

Then Mercury is in the first 10° (0°-10°), Jupiter is in the middle 10° (10°-20°) and
Venus is in the last 10° (20°-30°). So Mercury is placed in Gemini itself in drekkana
chart; Jupiter is placed in  Libra (5th from Gemini) in drekkana chart; and, Venus is
placed in Aquarius (9th from Gemini) in drekkana chart.

6.2.4  Chaturthamsa Chart (D-4)

Each rasi is divided into 4 equal parts of 7.5° each. Bodies in the first, second, third
and fourth 7.5° arc of a rasi are in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th from that rasi (respectively)
in chaturthamsa. In other words, planets in 0°-7.5° in a rasi go into 1st from that rasi;
planets in 7.5°-15° go into 4th from that rasi; planets in 15°-22.5° go into the 7th from
that rasi; and, planets in the 22.5°-30° go into the 10th from that rasi.

This chart is also known as Chaturamsa or Turyamsa.

Example 12: Let us say Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are together in Taurus. Mercury
is at 3°, Jupiter is at 14° and Venus is at 23°.

Mercury is in 0°-7.5° arc, i.e. the first 7.5° arc, of Ta. So he is in Ta (1st from Ta) in
D-4.
Jupiter is in 7.5°-15° arc, i.e. the second 7.5° arc, of Ta. So he is in Le (4th from Ta)
in D-4.
Venus is in 22.5°-30° arc, i.e. the fourth 7.5° arc, of Ta. So he is in Aq (10th from Ta)
in D-4.

6.2.5

Panchamsa Chart (D-5)

  54

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Each rasi is divided into 5 equal parts of 6° each. Bodies in the 5 parts of an odd rasi
go into Ar, Aq, Sg, Ge and Li (respectively). Bodies in the 5 parts of an even rasi go
into Ta, Vi, Pi, Cp and Sc (respectively).

6.2.6

Shashthamsa Chart (D-6)

Each rasi is divided into 6 equal parts of 5° each. Bodies in the 6 parts of a rasi go
into the 6 rasis starting from Ar or Li, based on whether the rasi is odd or even.

Example 13: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 3rd part of the rasi and 19° is in the 4th part of the rasi. Ge is an odd
rasi and counting starts from Ar. The 3rd from Ar is Ge. So the 3rd part in Ge goes
into Ge in D-6. On the other hand, Sc is an even rasi and counting starts from Li. The
4th from Li is Cp. So the 4th part of Sc goes into Cp in D-6. So Mercury is in Ge and
Jupiter is in Cp in D-6 for this example.

6.2.7

Saptamsa Chart (D-7)

Each rasi is divided into 7 equal parts of 4° 17' 8.57''. Bodies in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
5th, 6th and 7th parts of a rasi go into the 7 rasis starting from the rasi itself, if it is an
odd rasi, or starting from the 7th sign from it, if it is an even rasi.

Example 14: Let us say Mercury is at 10° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Vi. We see
that 10° is in the 3rd part of the rasi and 19° is in the 5th part of the rasi. Because Ge is
an odd rasi, the 3rd part in Ge goes into the 3rd from Ge, i.e. Le. On the other hand, Vi
is an even sign and counting starts from the 7th from it, i.e. Pi. The 5th from Pi is Cn.
So the 5th part of Vi goes into Cn. So Mercury is in Le and Jupiter is in Cn in D-7 for
this example.

6.2.8  Ashtamsa Chart (D-8)

Each rasi is divided into 8 equal parts of 3° 45' each. Bodies in the eight parts of a
rasi  go  into  the  8  rasis  starting  from  Ar,  Sg  or  Le,  based  on  whether  the  rasi  is  a
movable, fixed or dual sign.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

55

Example 15: Let us say Mercury is at 10° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 10° is in the 3rd part of the rasi and 19° is in the 6th part of the rasi. Because Ge is
a dual rasi, counting starts from Le. The 3rd from Le is Li. So the 3rd part in Ge goes
into Li in D-8. On the other hand, Sc is a fixed sign and counting starts from Sg. The
6th from Sg is Ta. So the 6th part of Sc goes into Ta in D-8. So Mercury is in Le and
Jupiter is in Ta in D-8 for this example.

6.2.9  Navamsa Chart (D-9)

Each rasi is divided into 9 equal parts of 3° 20' each. Bodies in the 9 parts of a rasi
go into the 9 rasis starting from Ar, Cp, Li or Cn, based on whether the rasi is a fiery,
earthy, airy or watery sign.

This chart is also known as Dharmamsa. It is the most popular chart after rasi chart
and some astrologers simply refer to it as “Amsa” (division).

Example 16: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 4th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 6th part of the rasi. Because Ge is
an airy rasi, counting starts from Li. The 4th from Li is Cp. So the 4th part in Ge goes
into Cp in D-9. On the other hand, Sc is a watery sign and counting starts from Cn.
The 6th from Cn is Sg. So the 6th part of Sc goes into Sg in D-9. So Mercury is in Cp
and Jupiter is in Sg in D-9 for this example.

6.2.10  Dasamsa Chart (D-10)

Each rasi is divided into 10 equal parts of 3° each. Bodies in the 10 parts of a rasi go
into the 10 rasis starting from the rasi itself or the 9th from it, based on whether the
rasi is an odd or even sign.

This chart is also known as Dasamaamsa or Karmamsa or Swargamsa.

Example 17: Let us say Mercury is at 10° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 10° is in the 4th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 7th part of the rasi. Because Ge is
an odd rasi, counting starts from Ge itself. The 4th from Ge is Vi. So the 4th part in
Ge goes into Vi in D-10. On the other hand, Sc is an even sign and counting starts

  56

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

from the 9th from it, i.e. Cn. The 7th from Cn is Cp. So the 7th part of Sc goes into Cp
in D-10. So Mercury is in Vi and Jupiter is in Cp in D-10 for this example.

6.2.11  Rudramsa Chart (D-11)

Each rasi is divided into 11 equal parts of 2° 43' 38'' each. Count rasis from Ar to the
rasi  being  divided,  in  the  zodiacal  order.  Count  the  same  number  of  rasis  anti-
zodiacally11 from Ar. Bodies in the 11 parts of the rasi go into the 11 rasis starting
from the rasi found thus.

This chart is also known as Ekadasamsa.

Example 18: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 5th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 7th part of the rasi. In the case of
Ge,  it  is  the  3rd  rasi  from  Ar.  The  3rd  rasi  from  Ar  in  the  reverse  order  is  Aq.  So
counting starts from the Aq. The 5th from Aq is Ge. So the 5th part in Ge goes into Ge
in D-11. In the case of Sc, it is the 8th rasi from Ar. Counting the 8th rasi from Ar in
the reverse order, we get Vi. So counting starts from Vi. The 7th from Vi is Pi. So the
7th part of Sc goes into Pi in D-11. So Mercury is in Ge and Jupiter is in Pi in D-11
for this example.

6.2.12  Dwadasamsa Chart (D-12)

Each rasi is divided into 12 equal parts of 2° 30' each. Bodies in the 12 parts of a rasi
go into the 12 rasis starting from the rasi itself.

Example 19: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 5th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 8th part of the rasi. The 5th from
Ge is Li. So the 5th part in Ge goes into Li in D-12. The 8th from Sc is Ge. So the 8th
part of Sc goes into Ge in D-12. So Mercury is in Li and Jupiter is in Ge in D-12 for
this example.

6.2.13  Shodasamsa Chart (D-16)

11 The zodiacal order is: Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, …
The anti-zodiacal order is: Ar, Pi, Aq, Cp, Sg, …

Part 1: Chart Analysis

57

Each rasi is divided into 16 equal parts of 1° 52' 30'' each. Bodies in the 16 parts of a
rasi  go  into  the  16  rasis  starting  from  Ar,  Le  and  Sg,  based  on  whether  the  rasi  is
movable,  fixed  or  dual.  When  counting  rasis  from  a  given  rasi,  we  go  zodiacally.
After going over the 12 rasis from a rasi, we get the same rasi as the 13th rasi. So the
13th, 14th, 15th and 16th rasis from a rasi are simply the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th rasis.

This chart is also known as Kalamsa.

Example 20: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 6th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 11th part of the rasi. Ge is a dual
rasi and we start counting from Sg. The 6th from Sg is Ta. So the 6th part in Ge goes
into Ta in D-16. On the other hand, Sc is a fixed sign and we start counting from Le.
The 11th from Le is Ge. So the 11th part of Sc goes into Ge in D-16. So Mercury is in
Ta and Jupiter is in Ge in D-16 for this example.

6.2.14  Vimsamsa Chart (D-20)

Each rasi is divided into 20 equal parts of 1° 30' each. Bodies in the 20 parts of a rasi
go  into  the  20  rasis  starting  from  Ar,  Sg  and  Le,  based  on  whether  the  rasi  is
movable, fixed or dual.

Example 21: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 8th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 13th part of the rasi. Because Ge
is a dual rasi, we start counting from Le. The 8th from Le is Pi. So the 8th part in Ge
goes  into  Pi  in  D-20.  On  the  other  hand,  Sc  is  a  fixed  sign  and  the  counting  starts
from Sg. The 13th from Sg is Sg itself (13th = 1st, after removing 12). So the 13th part
of Sc goes into Sg in D-20. So Mercury is in Pi and Jupiter is in Sg in D-20 for this
example.

6.2.15  Chaturvimsamsa Chart (D-24)

Each rasi is divided into 24 equal parts of 1° 15' each. Bodies in the 24 parts of a rasi
go into the 24 rasis starting from Le or Cn, based on whether the rasi is odd or even.

This chart is also called Siddhamsa.

  58

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 22: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 9th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 16th part of the rasi. Ge is an odd
rasi  and  counting  starts  from  Le.  The  9th  from  Le  is  Ar.  So  the  9th  part  in  Ge  goes
into Ar in D-24. On the other hand, Sc is an even rasi and counting starts from Cn.
The 16th from Cn is Li (16th = 4th, after removing 12). So the 16th part of Sc goes into
Li in D-24. So Mercury is in Ar and Jupiter is in Li in D-24 for this example.

6.2.16  Nakshatramsa Chart (D-27)

Each rasi is divided into 27 equal parts of 1° 6' 40'' each. Bodies in the 27 parts of a
rasi go into the 12 rasis starting from Ar, Cn, Li and Cp based on whether the rasi is
a fiery, earthy, airy or watery rasi.

This chart is also called Saptavimsamsa or  Bhamsa.

Example 23: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 10th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 18th part of the rasi. Because
Ge is an airy rasi, counting starts from Li. The 10th from Li is Le. So the 10th part in
Ge goes into Le in D-27. On the other hand, Sc is a watery sign and counting starts
from Cp. The 18th from Cp is Ge (18th = 6th, after removing 12). So the 18th part of
Sc goes into Ge in D-27. So Mercury is in Le and Jupiter is in Ge in D-27 for this
example.

6.2.17  Trimsamsa Chart (D-30)

D-30 positions of planets are computed based on the following rules:

Odd Rasis:
•  Bodies in 0°-5° in odd rasis are placed in Ar in D-30.
•  Bodies in 5°-10° in odd rasis are placed in Aq in D-30.
•  Bodies in 10°-18° in odd rasis are placed in Sg in D-30.
•  Bodies in 18°-25° in odd rasis are placed in Ge in D-30.
•  Bodies in 25°-30° in odd rasis are placed in Li in D-30.

Even Rasis:

Part 1: Chart Analysis

•  Bodies in 0°-5° in even rasis are placed in Ta in D-30.
•  Bodies in 5°-12° in even rasis are placed in Vi in D-30.
•  Bodies in 12°-20° in even rasis are placed in Pi in D-30.
•  Bodies in 20°-25° in even rasis are placed in Cp in D-30.
•  Bodies in 25°-30° in even rasis are placed in Sc in D-30.

6.2.18  Khavedamsa Chart (D-40)

Each rasi is divided into 40 equal parts of 45' each. Bodies in the 40 parts of a rasi go
into the 40 rasis starting from Ar or Li, based on whether the rasi is odd or even.

This chart is also called Chatvarimsamsa.

Example 24: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 15th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 26th part of the rasi. Because
Ge is an odd rasi, counting starts from Ar. The 15th from Ar is Ge (15th = 3rd, after
removing 12). So the 15th part in Ge goes into Ge in D-40. On the other hand, Sc is
an  even  rasi  and  counting  starts  from  Li.  The  26th  from  Li  is  Sc  (26th  =  2nd,  after
removing multiples of 12). So the 26th part of Sc goes into Sc in D-40. So Mercury is
in Ge and Jupiter is in Sc in D-40 for this example.

6.2.19  Akshavedamsa Chart (D-45)

Each rasi is divided into 45 equal parts of 40' each. Bodies in the 45 parts of a rasi go
into the 45 rasis starting from Ar, Le or Sg, based on whether the rasi is a movable,
fixed or dual rasi.

This chart is also called Pancha-chatvarimsamsa.

Example 25: Let us say Mercury is at 11° in Ge and Jupiter is at 19° in Sc. We see
that 11° is in the 17th part of the rasi and 19° is in the 29th part of the rasi. Because
Ge is a dual rasi, we start counting from Sg. The 17th from Sg is Ar (17th = 5th, after
removing 12). So the 17th part in Ge goes into Ar in D-45. On the other hand, Sc is a
fixed rasi and counting starts from Le. The 29th from Le is Sg. So the 29th part of Sc

  60

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

goes  into  Sg  in  D-45.  So  Mercury  is  in  Ar  and  Jupiter  is  in  Sg  in  D-45  for  this
example.

6.2.20  Shashtyamsa Chart (D-60)

Each rasi is divided into 60 equal parts of 30' each. Bodies in the 60 parts of a rasi go
into the 60 rasis starting the rasi itself.

To see the part occupied by a body, we can take its longitude from the beginning of
the occupied rasi, multiply it by 2, take degrees and ignore minutes, add 1 to it.

Example 26:  Let us say Jupiter is at 222° 58' , i.e. 12° 58' in Scorpio. Multiplying
12°  58'  by  2,  we  get  25°  56'.  Taking  degrees  and  ignoring  minutes,  we  get  25.
Adding 1, we get 26. So 12° 58' is in the 26th part of rasi (where each part is 1/60th of
rasi, i.e. 30'). So we have to count the 26th rasi from Sc. Removing multiples of 12
from  26,  we  get  2.  The  2nd  rasi  from  Sc  is  Sg.  So  Jupiter  is  in  Sg  in  D-60  in  this
example.

6.3  Divisional Chart Significations

Insights on Divisional Charts

Divisional charts based on divisions between 1 and 12 operate in the physical plane.
They show physical matters. Body, wealth, residence, wife, children, parents – these
are all matters relating to the physical self.

Divisional charts based on divisions between 13 and 24 (i.e. D-16, D-20 and D-24)
operate in the mental plane. They show matters that exist at the mental plane. Sense
of  pleasure  and  unhappiness,  religiousness,  learning  and  knowledge  –  these  are  all
matters relating to the mind and intellect.

Divisional charts based on divisions between 25 and 36 (i.e. D-27 and D-30) operate
in  the  plane  of  sub-consciousness.  One’s  strengths,  weaknesses,  inherent  nature,
evils,  certain  psychological  imbalances  –  these  are  all  matters  relating  to  the  sub-
conscious self.

Divisional charts based on divisions above 36 (i.e. D-40, D-45 and D-60) operate in
a  kaarmic  plane  of  existence  that  is  above  physical  self,  mind  and  sub-conscious
self. Based on the karma from previous lives, we all have an existence at a level that
goes beyond the levels of body, mind and sub-consciousness. Existence at that level

  62

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

has a considerable role in deciding the pattern of one’s life, along with existence at
the physical, mental and sub-conscious levels. Higher divisional charts like D-40, D-
45 and D-60 throw light on this subtle aspect of chart analysis.12

6.5  Using Divisional Charts

It is very important to memorize Table 11. We should choose the divisional chart to
analyze,  based  on  the  matter  we  are  interested  in.  If  we  want  to  know  something
about  one’s  career,  for  example,  we  should  analyze  one’s  dasamsa  chart  (D-10).  If
we want to know something about one’s luxuries and pleasures, we should analyze
one’s shodasamsa (D-16). Based on the matter of interest, we decide which area of
life is relevant and analyze the corresponding divisional chart.

We  should  remember  which  planets,  rasis  and  houses  show  a  particular  matter  and
find links between them in the divisional chart of interest.

Suppose  we  want  to  see  when  one  would  go  abroad.  It  is  related  to  residence  and
fortune  and  we  should  analyze  one’s  chaturthamsa  (D-4).  The  9th  and  12th  houses
show  foreign  residence.  Rahu  signifies  foreign  residence.  We  should  now  look  for
links. If 12th lord is with Rahu in the 9th house in D-4, it can suggest that one would
live abroad, probably during the periods of Rahu or 12th lord or 9th house.

Suppose we want to see when one would get a promotion at the office. Because D-10
shows one’s  career and  achievements, we should analyze D-10. Because  GL (ghati
lagna)  shows  power  and  authority,  planets  or  rasis  giving  a  promotion  are  usually
connected with GL. They are in GL or aspect GL. Because AL shows status, planets
associating with AL or the5th or the 10th from it are favorable. If the lord of AL is in
the 10th from it and aspects GL, probably his period will give a promotion.

In this manner, we should analyze the divisional chart that signifies the sphere of life
that we are interested in and analyze the houses that show the matter of interest. This
is  the  key  to  correct  chart  analysis.  We  will  see  many  examples  of  this  in  coming
chapters.

12 The content of this paragraph has philosophical undercurrents that  may be difficult to  understand
for  students  without  a  good  background  in  Hindu  philosophy.  This  knowledge  should  be  learnt
directly from a competent guru. Readers are advised to leave these higher charts until they find one.

6.6  Varga Grouping and Amsabala

We have several varga groups, i.e. groups of divisional charts.

If a planet is in its moolatrikona or an own rasi or its rasi of exaltation in a chart, it
makes the planet very strong in that chart. In each group of divisional charts, we can
count the divisional charts in which a planet occupies its moolatrikona or an own rasi
or  its  rasi  of  exaltation.  Based  on  the  count  of  such  good  divisional  charts  for  the
planet, we say that the planet is in a particular amsa (the higher this number is, the
stronger the planet is).

6.6.1

Shadvarga

“Shadvarga”  literally  means  “six  divisions”.  Shadvarga  is  a  group  of  the  following
divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-9, (5) D-12, and, (6) D-30.

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count of divisional
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation
or an own rasi is listed below:

Kimsukaamsa  –  2,  Vyanjanaamsa  –  3,  Chaamaraamsa  –  4,  Chatraamsa  –  5,
Kundalaamsa – 6.

6.6.2

Sapta varga

“Sapta  varga”  literally  means  “seven  divisions”.  Sapta  varga  is  a  group  of  the
following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-7, (5) D-9, (6) D-
12, and, (7) D-30.

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count of divisional
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation
or an own rasi is listed below:

Kimsukaamsa  –  2,  Vyanjanaamsa  –  3,  Chaamaraamsa  –  4,  Chatraamsa  –  5,
Kundalaamsa – 6, Mukutaamsa – 7.

  64

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

6.6.3  Dasa varga

“Dasa varga” literally means “ten divisions”. Dasa varga is a group of the following
divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-7, (5) D-9, (6) D-10, (7) D-
12, (8) D-16, (9) D-30, and, (10) D-60.

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count of divisional
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation
or an own rasi is listed below:

Paarijaataamsa  –  2,  Uttamaamsa  –  3,  Gopuraamsa–  4,  Simhaasanaamsa  –  5,
Paaraavataamsa  –  6,  Devalokaamsa  –  7,  Brahmalokamsa  –  8,  Airaavataamsa  –  9,
Sreedhaamaamsa – 10.

NOTE: This group is very important and some yogas – special combinations – make
use of these amsas. For example, lagna lord or ghati lagna lord in Simhaasanaamsa
would  make  one  very  famous.  A  quadrant  lord  with  good  amsabala  in  dasavarga
makes one very successful. Readers should memorize the above amsas.

6.6.4

Shodasa varga

“Shodasa varga” literally means “sixteen divisions”. Shodasa varga is a group of the
following divisional charts: (1) Rasi chart, (2) D-2, (3) D-3, (4) D-4, (5) D-7, (6) D-
9, (7) D-10, (8) D-12, (9) D-16, (10) D-20, (11) D-24, (12) D-27, (13) D-30, (14) D-
40, (15) D-45, and, (16) D-60.

The amsa said to be occupied by a planet and the corresponding count of divisional
charts – from the above list – in which it occupies its moolatrikona, rasi of exaltation
or an own rasi is listed below:

Bhedakaamsa  –  2,  Kusumaamsa  –  3,  Nagapurushaamsa  –  4,  Kandukaamsa  –  5,
Keralaamsa – 6, Kalpavrikshaamsa – 7, Chandanavanaamsa – 8, Poornachandraamsa
–  9,  Uchchaisravaamsa  –  10,  Dhanvantaryamsa  –  11,  Sooryakaantaamsa  –  12,
Vidrumaamsa  –  13,  Indraasanaamsa  –  14,  Golokaamsa  –  15,  Sree  Vallabhaamsa  –
16.

Example  27:  Let  us  look  at  the  chart  of  Bill  Cosby.  He  is  a  famous  TV  and  film
actor  in  USA.  He  is  one  of  the  greatest  theatrical  personalities  of  the  world  and  a
natural  actor.  He  is  known  as  a  charitable  person  who  donated  huge  amounts  of
money for the education of African American kids. His birthdata is: 12th July 1937,
12:30 am (Time Zone: 5:00 west of GMT), 75 W 10, 39 N 57.

The 9th house shows charitable nature and the 12th house shows expenditure. Jupiter
owns the 9th and 12th houses and occupies the 9th house here. This may be the reason
for Mr. Cosby’s charitable nature. Let us see the amsabala of Jupiter. Jupiter is at 29°
49' in Sg. The signs occupied by him in various charts are shown below:

Rasi: Sg, D-2: Cn, D-3: Li, D-4: Vi, D-7: Ge, D-9: Sg, D-10: Vi, D-12: Sc, D-16:
Pi, D-20: Pi, D-24: Cn, D-27: Ge, D-30: Li, D-40: Cn, D-45: Le, D-60: Sc.

Jupiter owns Sg and Pi. His moolatrikona is Sg. He is exalted in Cn. So we have to
count the charts in which he is in Cn, Sg or Pi.

(1) Out of the 6 divisional charts of shadvarga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 3 charts –

Rasi, D-2 and D-9. So Jupiter is in Vyanjanaamsa.

(2) Out of the 7 divisional charts of sapta varga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 3 charts

–Rasi, D-2 and D-9. So Jupiter is in Vyanjanaamsa.

(3) Out of the 10 divisional charts of dasa varga, Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 4 charts

–Rasi, D-2,  D-9 and D-16. So Jupiter is in Gopuraamsa.

(4) Out of the 16 divisional charts of shodasa varga,  Jupiter is in Cn, Sg or Pi in 7
charts  –Rasi,  D-2,  D-9,  D-16,  D-20,  D-24  and  D-40.  So  Jupiter  is  in
Kalpavrikshaamsa.

Being in Gopuramsa and Kalpavrikshamsa makes Jupiter very strong.

6.7  Conclusion

The  science  of  Vedic  astrology  stands  on  the  basis  of  4  pillars  –  grahas  (planets),
rasis (signs), vargas (divisional charts) and bhavas (houses). This chapter covered the
third  pillar  –  divisional  charts.  If  readers  have  an  accurate  software  program  that

  66

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

gives all the divisional charts for any chart, it may be acceptable to ignore the details
of computation. However, it is good to be aware of the details.

For  D-8  and  D-11,  there  are  different  versions.  For  D-2  and  D-3  also,  there  are
variations.  Different  variations  of  divisional  charts  show  different  spheres  of
activities. However, we will ignore the variations in this book.

Twenty  divisional  charts  are  covered  here.  Each  divisional  chart  throws  light  on  a
specific sphere of activity. For example, D-10 shows career, D-9 shows marital life
and  D-7  shows  the  fortune  of  children.  Choosing  the  correct  divisional  chart  for
analyzing the matter of interest is the key to correct analysis.

7.   Houses

7.1

Introduction

The  zodiac  consists  of  12  rasis.  Each  rasi  is  said  to  form  a  house.  When  we  talk
about houses, we always have a point of reference. The rasi containing the point of
reference is the 1st house. The next rasi is the 2nd house. The rasi after that is the 3rd
house.  Suppose  Moon  is  in  Aquarius  and  suppose  we  want  houses  with  respect  to
Moon. Then Aquarius is the 1st house, Pisces is the 2nd house, Aries is the 3rd house,
Taurus is the 4th house and so on. As we go around the zodiac, we reach Capricorn
when we find the 12th house.

In the same chart, Sun may be in Taurus. When we find houses with respect to Sun,
Taurus contains the 1st house, Gemini contains the 2nd house, Cancer contains the 3rd
house and so on. If Ghati Lagna is in Virgo in the same chart, then the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
houses with respect to Ghati Lagna are in Virgo, Libra and Scorpio respectively.

Thus  we  can  find  houses  with  respect  to  different  references.  The  same  sign  may
contain the 2nd house with respect to one reference and the 6th house with respect to
another  reference.  If  we  mention  houses  without  clearly  specifying  the  reference
used,  it  means  that  the  reference  used  is  lagna  (ascendant).  Lagna  is  the  default
reference when finding houses.

Different  houses  stand  for  different  matters.  The  matters  signified  by  a  house  also
depend  on  the  reference  used.  Each  reference  throws  light  on  matters  of  a  specific
nature  and  that  colors  the  meaning  of  a  house.  For  example,  the  11th  house  from
lagna may stand for something and the 11th house from arudha lagna may stand for
something  else.  It  depends  on  the  kind  of  matters  shown  by  the  two  references  –
lagna and arudha lagna.

In addition, the matters signified by a house depend on the divisional chart in which
we  are  finding  houses.  Each  divisional  chart  throws  light  on  matters  of  a  specific
nature. Again, that colors the meaning of a house. The 4th house from lagna in D-16
may  mean  something  and  the  4th  house  from  lagna  in  D-24  may  mean  something

  68

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

else. We have already listed the areas of life seen from various divisional charts in
the chapter on “Divisional Charts”.

7.2  Significations of Houses

The  matters  signified  by  various  houses  are  listed  below.  For  further  discussion  on
the results of various houses, readers may refer either to the ancient classics or to the
modern classic – “How to Judge a Horoscope” (Vols I & II) by Dr. B.V. Raman.

First  House:  Physical  body,  complexion,  appearance,  head,  intelligence,  strength,
energy, fame, success, nature of birth, caste.

Second House: Wealth, assets, family, speech, eyes, mouth, face, voice, food.

Third  House:  Younger  co-borns,  confidants,  courage,  mental
strength,
communication  skills,  creativity,  throat,  ears,  arms,  father’s  death  (7th  from  9th),
expenditure on vehicles and house (12th from 4th), travels.

Fourth  House:  Mother,  vehicles,  house,  lands,  immovable  property,  motherland,
childhood,  wealth  from  real  estate,  education,  relatives,  happiness,  comforts,
pleasures, peace, state of mind, heart.

Fifth  House:  Children,  poorvapunya  (good  deeds  of  previous  lives),  intelligence,
knowledge  &  scholarship,  devotion,  mantras  (prayers),  stomach,  digestive  system,
authority/power, fame, love, affection, emotions, judgment, speculation.

Sixth  House:  Enemies,  service,  servants,  relatives,  mental  tension,  injuries,  health,
diseases, agriculture, accidents, mental affliction, mother’s younger brother, hips.

Seventh  House:  Marriage,  marital  life,  life  partner,  sex,  passion  (and  related
happiness),  long  journeys,  partners,  business,  death,  the  portion  of  the  body  below
the navel.

Eighth  House:  Longevity,  debts,  disease,  ill-fame,  inheritance,  loss  of  friends,
occult studies, evils, gifts, unearned wealth, windfall, disgrace, secrets, genitals.

Ninth House: Father, teacher, boss, fortune,  religiousness, spirituality,  God, higher
studies & high knowledge, fortune in a foreign land, foreign trips, diksha (joining a

Part 1: Chart Analysis

69

religious  order),  past  life  and  the  cause  of  birth,  grandchildren,  principles,  dharma,
intuition, compassion, sympathy, leadership, charity, thighs.

Tenth House: Growth, profession, career, karma (action), conduct in society, fame,
honors, awards, self-respect, dignity, knees.

Eleventh  House:  Elder  co-borns,  income,  gains,  realization  of  hopes,  friends,
ankles.

Twelfth  House:  Losses,  expenditure,  punishment,  imprisonment,  hospitalization,
pleasures in bed, misfortune, bad habits, sleep, meditation, donation, secret enemies,
heaven,
the  place  of  birth,  moksha
(emancipation/liberation).

left  eye,  feet,  residence  away  from

We can find houses from houses and concatenate the meanings in some places. For
example, the 3rd house shows younger brother. The 2nd house from the 3rd house  is
the 4th house (count 1, 2 from 3rd and get 3rd, 4th). So the 4th house shows the wealth,
speech etc of younger brother. The 7th house from the 3rd house is the 9th house and it
can show younger sibling’s spouse. The 11th house from lagna shows friends and the
4th house from lagna is nothing but the 6th house from the 11th house. So the 4th house
stands  for  enemies,  diseases  and  debts  of  friends.  In  this  manner,  we  can  deduce
many additional meanings of various houses.

7.3  Common References for Houses

It may be noted from the list above that each house shows many matters. It may be
confusing at first to pick the right meaning that is relevant in a particular analysis. It
becomes  easier  with  experience.  We  have  to  note  the  area  of  life  seen  in  the
divisional chart under examination. We have to choose the meanings of houses that
are relevant in that area of life. For example, the 4th house shows education, vehicle,
house  and  mother  (among  other  things).  A  list  of  the  areas  of  life  seen  in  various
divisional charts is given in the chapter on “Divisional Charts”. We see from it that
learning  is  seen  from  D-24,  pleasures  and  comforts  from  D-16,  house  and
immovable property from D-4 and parents from D-12. So the 4th houses in D-24, D-
16, D-4 and D-12 show education, vehicle, house and mother (respectively).

  70

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

We should also take cognisance of the kind of matters shown by various references
and interpret the meaning of a house accordingly. The 4th house from lagna, the 4th
house  from  arudha  lagna  and  the  4th  house  from  paaka  lagna  can  mean  different
things,  depending  on  the  matters  shown  by  lagna,  arudha  lagna  and  paaka  lagna.
Now we will learn about the most common references used in finding houses and the
matters shown by them.

Depending on the matter we are analyzing, we should look at the correct divisional
chart,  the  correct  reference  and  the  correct  house.  Then  only  good  results  can  be
obtained. All this complexity may be perplexing to new students. However, there is
something we should realize. Human existence is a very complicated thing and it is
silly  and  unscientific  to  expect  a  simplistic  model  for  the  complicated  human  life.
Though Vedic astrology has too many parameters used in chart analysis, they are all
important as they give us the degrees of freedom necessary for modeling something
as  complicated  as  human  life.  However,  if  we  do  not  understand  what  each
parameter means and end up using them in a mixed-up way, we will get nowhere. So
readers should strive to understand these basics very clearly.

7.3.1

Lagna

Lagna is the most commonly used reference when finding houses. If no reference is
mentioned when houses are listed, it means that lagna – the default reference – was
used.  Lagna  shows  true  self.  If  we  are  trying  to  understand  someone’s  status  in
society, lagna may not be the correct reference. Status does not relate to “true self”.
It  is  a  part  of  the  illusion  of  this  world.  However,  if  we  are  trying  to  understand
someone’s  intentions  in  doing  something  or  someone’s  knowledge  or  someone’s
persistence, it relates to “true self”. So they are seen from the houses counted from
lagna. Lagna shows true self. It shows the overall spirit of “I” (self).

7.3.2  Chandra Lagna (Moon lagna)

Chandra  lagna  means  Moon  taken  as  a  reference.  We  can  find  houses  from  Moon.
Because  Moon  is  the  significator  of  mind,  these  houses  show  things  from  the
perspective of mind. For example, someone may be working in a routine job, but he
may  have  an  active  and  enterprising  mind  and  he  may  be  using  it  in  his  career.  In
that  case,  the  10th  house  (career)  from  lagna  may  have  the  influence  of  Saturn

(routine job) and the 10th house from Moon may have the influence of Mars (active
and enterprising).

Houses counted from Moon are useful in looking at things from the point of view of
mind. When we judge how happy one is, how ambitious one is and how one views
one’s career, the role of mind is paramount. So Chandra lagna should not be ignored.

7.3.3  Ravi Lagna (Sun lagna)

Ravi lagna means Sun taken as a reference. We can find houses from Sun. Because
Sun is the significator of soul, these houses show things from the perspective of soul.
For things related to physical vitality also, Sun is an important reference.

7.3.4  Arudha Lagna

Computation  of  arudha  lagna  (AL)  will  be  explained  in  the  chapter  on  “Arudha
Padas”. For now, the readers should remember that arudha lagna shows how a native
is perceived in the world. It also shows the status of a native.

A  planet  in  the  10th  house  from  lagna  may  give  some  important  developments  in
one’s  profession.  A  planet  in  the  10th  house  from  Chandra  lagna  may  give  some
important mental activity in one’s profession. A planet in the 10th house from arudha
lagna may give some important developments in one’s professional status.

7.3.5

Paaka Lagna

Paaka  lagna  is  important  when  analyzing  the  natal  chart,  dasas  and  transits.  Paaka
lagna is nothing but lagna lord taken as a reference. If someone with Pisces lagna has
Jupiter in Cancer, then Cancer becomes paaka lagna. If someone with Leo lagna has
Sun in Virgo, Virgo becomes paaka lagna.

Rasis  represent  situations  and  forces  influencing  the  course  of  a  native’s  life  and
planets  represent  individual  beings.  Lagna  lord  represents  the  physical  self  of  a
native. So that is what paaka lagna shows. Houses counted from paaka lagna throw
light on matters related to the physical self of a native.

  72

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Lagna  shows  the  concept  of  self  and  it  deals  with  one’s  true  personality.  The
physical existence of the person is different from this conceptual self. This applies to
all  divisional  charts.  Let  us  take  an  example.  The  5th  house  shows  scholarship,
memory  and  success  in  competition.  All  these  are  related  to  learning  and  they  are
seen in D-24, the chart of learning. But they are better seen from different references.
Let us find the best reference for each.

Success in competition is related to the illusions and perceptions of the world and so
the  most  appropriate  reference  is  arudha  lagna.  The  5th  house  from  arudha  lagna
shows  success  in  competition.  Scholarship  is  not  a  measurable  attribute  of  the
physical  existence.  It  is  a  property  of  one’s  true  personality  and  one’s  conceptual
self.  So  the  5th  from  lagna  shows  scholarship.  If  we  take  the  self  that  exists
physically  and  take  its  part  as  applicable  to  the  area  of  life  shown  by  D-24  (i.e.
learning), memory is a direct attribute of that self. Memory is a property of one’s self
that physically exists. So the 5th house from paaka lagna shows memory the best.

Saturn’s  transit13  over  the  rasi  containing  one’s  lagna  may  throw  obstructions  and
hamper one’s activities. Saturn’s transit over the rasi containing one’s Chandra lagna
may  create  frustration  and  mental  depression.  Saturn’s  transit  over  the  rasi
containing one’s paaka lagna may leave one feeling sick all the time and attack the
physical vitality.

7.3.6  Karakamsa Lagna

Atma karaka stands for the soul of the person. Atma karaka is an important reference
point  in  a  chart.  Because  the  soul  is  an  important  factor  in  deciding  the  nature  of
inner self than the physical existence, atma karaka is an important reference point in
navamsa chart. Navamsa chart throws light on the inner self and the rasi occupied by
atma karaka in it is called “Karakamsa”. We can analyze navamsa chart with respect
to Karakamsa. The 12th house from Karakamsa shows the liberation of the soul and
the  situation  of  Ketu  there  is  conducive  to  moksha.  Propitiation  of  the  deities
corresponding to the strongest planet in the 12th house in navamsa from Karakamsa
lagna can take one’s soul towards moksha.

13 If a planet occupies, on a given day, a particular rasi, then it is said to “transit” in that sign on that
day. Transit positions refer to the positions of planets on a given day and natal positions refer to the
positions  of  planets  at  the  time  of  one’s  birth.  This  will  be  dealt  with  in  detail  in  the  part  “Transit
Analysis”.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

73

7.3.7  Ghati Lagna

Ghati lagna (GL) shows self, from the point of view of power,  authority and fame.
When  we  analyze  promotions  in  career  or  political  power  of  politicians,  this
reference is very important.

7.3.8  Hora Lagna

Hora  lagna  (HL)  shows  self,  from  the  point  of  view  of  wealth.  This  reference  is
important when analyzing one’s wealth.

7.3.9  Graha Lagnas

Apart  from  the  above  references,  we  use  several  “graha  lagnas”  or  planetary
references. For each house, a planet works as the natural significator. To see matters
signified  by  a  house,  we  can  take  the  relevant  planet  as  the  reference.  The  list  of
houses that can be seen from each planet is given in Table 12.

When  we  analyze  courage  or  persistence  or  weapons  or  younger  brothers  or  the
expenditure on house or the expenditure on car, we have to analyze the 3rd house in
the relevant divisional chart. In all those cases, we can see the 3rd house from lagna
and the 3rd house from Mars and draw conclusions based on the strength of both. If

  74

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Mars  is  stronger  than  lagna,  then  the  3rd  house  from  Mars  may  be  more  important
than the 3rd house from lagna. Similarly, we see the 4th from lagna and the 4th from
Moon for mother. We see the 9th from Sun and the 9th from lagna for father. We see
the 12th from lagna and the 12th from Saturn for losses. We see the 5th from lagna and
the 5th from Jupiter for progeny. We see the 7th from lagna and the 7th from Venus
for marriage.

In  addition  to  the  above  list,  we  can  find  a  house  with  respect  to  the  naisargika
karaka  (natural  significator)  who  signifies  the  matter  shown  by  a  house.  For
example,  Venus  signifies  vehicles.  D-16  is  the  chart  that  shows  vehicles  and
pleasures.  So  the  4th  from  Venus  in  D-16  can  show  one’s  happiness  from  vehicles
and  other  luxuries.  As  Mercury  is  the  natural  significator  of  speech,  the  2nd  house
from lagna and the 2nd house from Mercury show speech (in rasi, D-9 and D-2714). A
complete  list  of  naisargika  karakas  of  different  matters  can  be  found  in the  chapter
on “Karakas”.

7.4  Special Categories

There are some special categories of houses:

(1) The  1st,  5th  and  9th  houses  form  a  triangle  and  they  are  known  as  “konas”  or

“trikonas” or “trines”.

(2) The 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses are called “kendras” or “quadrants” or “angles”.
(3) The 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses are called “panapharas” or “succedants”. These

are basically the quadrants from the 2nd house.

(4) The  3rd,  6th,  9th  and  12th houses  are  called  “apoklimas”  or  “precedants”.  These

are basically the quadrants from the 3rd house.

(5) The 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th houses are called “upachayas”.

14  Rasi  chart  shows  the  overall  picture  and  the  manifestation  at  the  physical  level.  Navamsa  shows
basic skills and the way one interacts with others. D-27 shows one’s strengths and weaknesses. All the
three charts are important. One may have strong benefics in the 2nd from lagna in rasi and navamsa
charts, but malefics in the 2nd from Mercury in D-27. In such a case, one will be a skilled speaker, but
harsh  speech  may  be  his  weakness.  D-27  throws  light  on  the  sub-conscious  self  and  shows  one’s
inherent strengths and weaknesses.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

75

(6) The  6th,  8th  and  12th  houses  are  called  “trik  sthanas”  or  “dusthanas”  (bad/evil

houses).

(7) The 4th and 8th houses are called “chaturasras”.

We can find trines, quadrants etc from lagna or other references or even from houses.
We  can  find  houses  with  respect  to  a  reference  and  then  find  trines,  quadrants  etc
with  respect  to  those  houses.  For  example,  let  us  take  the  3rd  house  from  lagna.
Trines from it are the 1st, 5th and 9th houses from it. The 5th house from the 3rd house
is the 7th house (count 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 starting from the 3rd house. We get 3rd, 4th, 5th,
6th  and  7th.  So  the  5th  from  3rd  is  7th).  The  9th  house  from  the  3rd  house  is  the  11th
house. So 3rd, 7th and 11th houses are the trines from the 3rd house. Similarly, the 3rd,
6th, 9th and 12th houses are the quadrants from the 3rd house. And the 5th, 8th, 12th and
1st houses are the upachayas from the 3rd house. The 8th, 10th and 2nd houses are the
dusthanas from the 3rd house. Thus we can find trines, quadrants etc from any house.

7.4.1

Trines

Trines  are  the  abode  of  Goddess  Lakshmi,  who  rules  prosperity.  Trines  from  any
reference  are  houses  that  are  beneficial  to  the  reference.  They  bring  prosperity  and
well-being to the reference. For example, trines from lagna shows prosperity of self.

In  Hinduism,  there  are  4  purushaarthas  (purposes/goals  of  man)  –  (1)  Dharma:
righteousness and adherence to one’s duty, (2) Artha: money and career, (3) Kaama:
desiring things and getting them, and, (4) Moksha: final liberation of soul.

Dharma is shown by the trines from the 1st house – 1st, 5th and 9th – and they show
prosperity  of  self,  intelligence  and  dharma15.  They  are  called  “dharma  trikonas”
(trines  of  duty).  The  character  of  a  person,  his  intelligence  and  his  righteousness
decide how one follows dharma – the first purpose of human existence.

Trines from the 2nd house are called “artha trikonas” (trines of money) and they show
money related activities. The 2nd house shows wealth. The 6th house shows service.
The  10th  house  shows  career  and  activities  in  society.  These  three  houses  show
money related activities and how one follows artha – the second purpose of human
existence.

15 Dharma literally means duty. However, it has come to mean righteousness.

  76

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Trines  from  the  3rd  house  are  called  “kaama  trikonas”  (trines  of  desire)  and  they
show one’s desires and how one gets them. The 3rd house shows one’s persistence.
The  7th  house  shows  relations  and  sex.  The  11th  house  shows  gains.  These  three
houses show how one follows kaama – the third purpose of human existence.

Trines from the 4th house (4th – harmony, 8th – occult studies and spiritual awakening
and 12th – moksha) are called “moksha trikonas” (trines of liberation) and they show
how one follows moksha – the fourth purpose of human existence.

Digbala  of  planets  who  attain  full  digbala  in  various  of  these  trines  shows  the
strength of different purushaarthas in one’s life. Dasas like “Trikona Dasa” which are
based on trines show how one follows the four purushaarthas in life.

Planets in mutual trines16 make each other prosper.

7.4.2  Quadrants

Quadrants  are  the  abode  of  Sri  Maha  Vishnu,  the  Supreme  Lord  who  sustains  this
universe as per Hinduism. Quadrants from any reference show its sustenance. The 1st
house (self), 4th house (comforts), 7th house (marriage and relations with others) and
the 10th house (profession) sustain each other.

Planets in mutual quadrants17 have a sustaining effect on each other.

7.4.3  Upachayas

Upachayas  from  a  reference  show  forces  causing  gains  and  growth  to  the  matters
signified  by  the  reference.  For  example,  arudha  lagna  shows  one’s  status  and  the
upachayas from arudha lagna show improvement of status.

7.4.4  Dusthanas

16 We say that two planets are in “mutual trines”, if one planet is in a trine from the other.
17 We say that two planets are in “mutual quadrants”, if one planet is in a quadrant from the other.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

77

Dusthanas from a reference show forces causing setbacks to the matters signified by
it. If a dusthana is fortified or afflicted by malefics, it may show serious obstacles. If
a  dusthana  is  weak,  it  shows  that  obstacles  will  be  easily  overcome.  For  example,
exalted  8th  lord  may  show  a  lot  of  troubles  and  debilitated  8th  lord  may  show  easy
sailing.

7.4.5  Visible Half and Invisible Half

The zodiac is divided into two halves in every chart: The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and
12th  houses  form  the  “visible  half”  of  the  zodiac.  The  1st,  2nd,  3rd,  4th,  5th  and  6th
houses form the “invisible half” of the zodiac. The houses in the visible half of the
zodiac with respect to a reference give results that can be seen in the material world
and  the  houses  in  the  invisible  half  of  the  zodiac  give  results  that  cannot  be  easily
seen.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  bases  of  dharma  trikona  (1st  house)  and  moksha
trikona (4th house) are in the invisible half and the bases of artha trikona (10th house)
and kaama trikona (7th house) are in the visible half.

7.5  A Controversy

Houses are found with respect to lagna, special lagnas and some planets. Houses are
found in rasi chart and in all the divisional charts. Some scholars ignore all these and
take houses only with respect to lagna and only in rasi chart. They prepare something
called “bhaava chakra” or “chalit chakra”, in which houses can start in one rasi and
end in another. They take lagna’s longitude to be the mid-point of the first house and
construct all the houses accordingly. In the “equal house method”, they take a 30º arc
with center at lagna as the 1st house. The next 30º arc is taken as the 2nd house and so

18 This will be covered in the chapter on “Aspects and Argalas”.

  78

on.  This  method  is  popular  among  Indian  astrologers.  Another  method  taught  by
Sripathi  is  more  complicated  and  it  is  also  popular.  However,  this  author
recommends  neither.  Each  rasi  is  a  house.  The  rasi  containing  the  reference  point
chosen is the 1st house and the next rasi is the 2nd house.

Though  there  are  some  indirect  references  in  BPHS19  suggesting  that  Parasara
supported  house  divisions  placing  houses  in  2  rasis,  there  are  quite  a  few  direct
references making it amply clear that each house falls in one rasi. Parasara taught us
to  find  houses  by  counting  rasis  from  the  reference  chosen.  Moreover,  only  this
approach  is  logical  as  we  go  to  divisional  charts.  Parasara’s  treatment  does  not
differentiate between rasi and divisional charts, as far as the basic techniques go.

So  readers  are  advised  to  ignore  all  the  discussions  found  in  other  textbooks  on
house  division  methods,  “bhaava  chakra”  and  “chalit  chakra”.  It  may  do  good  to
follow the instructions in this chapter.

19 “Brihat Paaraasara Hora Saastram” is a classic by Sage Parasara. It is the most authentic and final
treatise on Vedic astrology. It was written more than 5,000 years ago.

8.   Karakas

8.1

Introduction

The word karaka 20 means “one who causes”. Karaka of a matter is the significator of
the matter. He is the one who causes events related to that matter.

There are 3 kinds of karakas:

(1) Naisargika karakas (natural significators, 9 in number).
(2) Chara karakas (variable significators, 8 in number), and,
(3) Sthira karakas (fixed significators, 7 in number),

One should not use the three types of karakas in  a mixed-up way. Karakas of each
type have a specific purpose. One should understand the distinction between chara,
sthira and naisargika karakas clearly and use them accordingly.

Naisargika karakas shows everything that exists in the creation. They include Rahu,
Ketu and the seven planets. They are presided by Brahma. Naisargika karakas show
not only human beings, but they show various impersonal things and matters. They
show  everything  that  exists  in  Brahma’s  creation  and  affects  a  person.  Naisargika
karakas are very useful in phalita Jyotish, i.e. analysis of general results.

Chara  karakas  include  Rahu  and  the  seven  planets.  They  do  not  include  Ketu,  as
Ketu  stands  for  moksha  (emancipation)  and  does  not  stand  for  any  person  who
affects  one’s  sustenance.  Chara  karakas  are  presided  by  Vishnu  and  they  show
people  who  play  a  role  in  one’s  life.  As  Vishnu  presides  over  activities  related  to
sustenance, achievements and spiritual progress, chara karakas show these aspects of
one’s  life.  Chara  karakas  show  people  who  play  an  important  role  in  one’s
sustenance  and  achievements.  Examples  are  –  mother,  father,  wife,  advisors  etc.
Chara  karakas  are  very  useful  in  Raja  Yogas  and  in  spiritual  progress.  They  also
show how our karma (cumulative sum of actions) is carried from one life to another.

20 This is pronounced as “kaaraka”.

  80

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Sthira karakas include only 7 planets because only they have physical bodies. They
are presided by Shiva. As Shiva presides over death21, they show the destruction of
body. Sthira karakas are useful in timing the death of various near relatives.

8.2  Chara Karakas

We use the following procedure to find chara karakas:

(1) Take the eight planets – Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and
Rahu.  For  each  planet,  find  its  advancement  from  the  beginning  of  the  rasi
occupied by it. For Rahu, measure the advancement from the end of his rasi.

(2) Arrange them in the decreasing order of advancement.
(3) The  planet  with  the  highest  advancement  is  Atma  Karaka  (significator  of  self).

We will denote him by AK. Find other chara karakas using Table 13.

If  two  planets  have  the  same  degrees,  we  should  compare  minutes.  If  minutes  are
same,  we  should  compare  the  seconds.  If  two  planets  are  exactly  at  the  same
longitude,  then  they  will  hold  a  karakatwa  (signification)  together  and  the  next

21 In Indian philosophy, death is nothing but praana (life) becoming sthira (fixed).
22 PK can also show subordinates and followers. PiK can show a boss.
23 In practical terms, this means people who give advice (advisors and counsellors).
24  In  the  symbol  “jn”  here,  ‘j’  is  the  voiced  palatal  consonant  and  ‘n’  is  the  palatal  nasal.  This  is  a
tough sound to pronounce correctly. Some people approximate it as as “gnaati” or “gyaati”.
25  This  karaka  is  commonly  used  for  enemies  or  rivals.  However,  the  literal  meaning  of  “jnaati”  is
“paternal cousin”.

karakatwa will have no ruler. We should use the corresponding sthira karaka in that
case. However, this rarely becomes necessary, as two planets are rarely at exactly the
same longitude.

Example  28:  Consider  the  following  planetary  position  –  Sun:  12Ge47,  Moon:
20Ar28, Mars: 13Ge51,  Mercury: 25Ge18, Jupiter: 5Ta40, Venus: 17Ge21, Saturn:
2Ta28,  Rahu:  1Cn43.  Advancements  of  planets  in  respective  rasis  are  found  and
arranged in the decreasing order in Table 14. Based on it, chara karakas are listed.

So  Rahu  represents  the  self  of  the  native  for  the  purpose  of  raja  yogas,  analysis  of
sustenance, achievements and spiritual evolution. AK throws light on the inner self
of a native. Rahu can show a spiritually advanced person or a saint on one hand and
a revolutionary or an outcast on the other. Mercury represents the native’s advisors
and he shows intellectuals when strong and indecisive people when weak.

Exercise  11:  Consider  the  following  planetary  position  –  Sun:  9Sg36,  Moon:
15Le29,  Mars:  13Ar40,  Mercury:  21Sc00,  Jupiter:  2Aq06,  Venus:  17Sg42,  Saturn:
9Sc41, Rahu: 14Ge30. Find chara karakas. Guess the nature of the inner self of the
native.

8.3  Sthira Karakas

The following is the list of sthira karakas:

  82

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Sun or Venus (stronger) 26: Father
Moon or Mars (stronger): Mother
Mars: Younger siblings, brother-in-law and sister-in-law (spouses of siblings)
Mercury: Maternal relatives (uncles and aunts)
Jupiter:  Husband,  sons,  paternal  grandparents  and  other  paternal  relatives  (uncles
and aunts)
Venus: Wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law & maternal grandparents
Saturn: Elder siblings27

The use of sthira karakas has already been explained. They are presided by Shiva and
they are used in the timing of death of the above relatives. They should not be used
in general predictive astrology in the place of naisargika karakas. For example, some
astrologers use the 7th from Jupiter instead of the 7th from Venus to predict marriage.
However, Venus is the natural significator of marriage and the 7th from Venus should
be used for predicting marriage, both in male and female charts. When predicting the
death of spouse, we use Jupiter in female charts and Venus in male charts.28

Another  difference  between  sthira  and  naisargika  karakas  is  that  sthira  karakas
themselves  represent  the  physical  bodies  of  the  relatives.  In  the  case  of  naisargika
karakas,  we  must  take  the  relevant  house  from  the  karaka.  For  example,  Jupiter
represents the physical body of husband in a female chart, for the purpose of timing
death.  For  the  purpose  of  timing  marriage,  the  7th  from  Venus  (and  not  Venus
himself) shows husband.

Chara karakas are also similar to sthira karakas in this aspect. We do not take the 7th
from DK for spouse, but DK himself shows spouse.

8.4  Naisargika Karakas

26 For methods to compare the strengths of planets, one may refer to the chapter “Strength of Planets
and Rasis”. Some people opine that Sun should be taken as the fixed significator of father for daytime
births and Venus for nighttime births. Similarly, Moon is taken as the fixed significator of mother for
nighttime births and Mars for daytime births.
27 Some scholars give Saturn as the sthira karaka for children instead of elder siblings.
28 Some scholars take Jupiter as the sthira karaka of spouse in male charts also.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

83

We  have  seen  that  chara  karakas  are  used  in  analyzing  the  influences  of  various
persons on a native, from the point of view of sustenance, achievements and spiritual
evolution.  We  have  seen  that  sthira  karakas  are  used  in  analyzing  the  death  of
relatives. In addition, we have naisargika karakas, who are the natural significators of
various  matters.  These  significations  are  used  in  general  Phalita  Jyotish.  Table  15
gives  a  list  of  naisargika  karakas.  For  example,  the  4th  house  from  Moon  shows
mother.  The  5th  house  from  Jupiter  shows  sons.  If  we  want  to  analyze  the  birth  of
children or analyze some simple events from their lives, we should take the 5th from
Jupiter. If we want to analyze some children-related troubles that punish one’s soul
or if we want to analyze some achievements and happiness related to children, they
will be more closely related to PK (putra karaka of chara karakas). If we want to time
the death of a child, sthira karaka for children (Jupiter) should be used.

9.   Arudha Padas

9.1

Introduction

Lagna  shows  true  self.  However,  people’s  perceptions  of  a  person  can  be  different
from reality. Usually, how one is perceived by others is more important in material
life than who one really is. A political leader perceived by people as a powerful and
influential person may in reality be a coward and a confused man always in doubt.
But the reality does not matter in deciding his material life. Perceptions matter more.
People  perceive  him  as  a  strong  leader  and  that  matters  the  most  in  deciding  his
political career.

A  political  leader  generally  perceived  as  an  honest  man  may  in  reality  be  badly
corrupt.  A  person  generally  perceived  as  an  intelligent  person  may  in  reality  be  of
average  intelligence.  An  intelligent  person  may  score  poorly  in  examinations  and
people may not know his intelligence.

If someone studied at IIT (a top engineering institute of India), people may think that
he  is  very  knowledgable.  If  someone  studied  at  an  obscure  university,  people  may
not  get  the  same  impression.  But  it  is  possible  that  people’s  perceptions  are  wrong
and the person who studied at IIT is less knowledgable. If an astrologer is frequented
by  a  top  politician,  people  may  get  an  impression  that  the  astrologer  is  good.  If  an
astrologer maintains a low profile, people may think that he is average. But the latter
astrologer may be more learned in reality.

What people perceive about a person can often be different from reality. However,
perceptions and reality are both important to an astrologer. For predicting some
matters,  we  need  knowledge  of  the  perceptions  (e.g.  success  of  a  politician  in
elections,  success  in  a  competitive  examination,  promotion  at  office  etc).  For
predicting  some  internal  matters,  on  the  other  hand,  true  self  should  be  clearly
understood.

So  we,  astrologers,  should  be  able  to  separate  reality  from  perceptions  and
understand both correctly. We should understand the true nature of a person and also

  86

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

how  he  is  perceived  by  the  world.  Arudha  padas  are  a  very  important  concept  of
Vedic astrology and they help us with that tough, but important, task.

9.2  Computation of Bhava Arudhas

Arudha padas of all the 12 houses (bhavas) in all the divisional charts are defined as
follows:

(1) Take sign containing the house of interest in the divisional chart of interest.

(2) Find the sign occupied by the lord of that house.

NOTE: Aquarius is owned by Saturn and Rahu. Scorpio is owned
by  Mars  and  Ketu.  Take  the  stronger  lord  in  the  case  of  houses
falling in these two signs. The chapter on “Strength of Planets and
Rasis”  will  explain  the  rules  used  in  comparing  the  strengths  of
planets.

(3) Count signs from the house of interest to the sign containing its lord. Counting is
in the zodiacal direction always. For example, if the house we are interested in is
in  Gemini  and  its  lord  Mercury  is  in  Aquarius,  we  count  signs  from  Gemini  to
Aquarius and get 9.

(4) Count  the  same  number  of  signs  from  the  sign  containing  the  lord  and  find  the
ending sign. In the above example, we count 9 signs from Aquarius and we end
up in Libra.

(5) Exception: If the sign found thus in step (4) is in the 1st or 7th from the original
sign  in  step  (1),  then  we  take  the  10th  sign  from  the  sign  found  in  step  (4).
Otherwise we don’t make any change.

(6) The resulting sign contains the arudha pada of the house of interest.

Arudha pada of a house  is simply called arudha or pada also.  In this book, we will
denote the arudha pada on nth house with An. For example, arudha pada of 4th house
is A4 and arudha pada of 9th house is A9.

There are two special cases: Arudha pada of lagna is denoted as AL (arudha lagna)
and arudha pada of 12th house is denoted as UL (upapada lagna).

Example 29: Consider Chart 1 and find the arudha padas of all the 12 houses.

Chart 1

(1)  First house is in Vi. Lord is Mercury and he is in Pi. Counting from Vi to Pi,
we get a count of 7. Counting 7 signs from Pi, we get Vi. However, this is in
the 1st from the original sign (Vi). So we take the 10th therefrom and get Ge.
AL is in Ge.

(2)  Second house is in Li. Lord is Venus and he is in Pi. Counting from Li to Pi,

we get a count of 6. Counting 6 signs from Pi, we get Le. A2 is in Le.

(3)  Third  house  is  in  Sc.  Lord  is  Mars  –  he  is  stronger  than  Ketu,  being  with  2
other planets – and he is in Ar. Counting from Sc to Ar, we get a count of 6.
Counting 6 signs from Ar, we get Vi. A3 is in Vi.

(4)  Fourth house is in Sg. Lord is Jupiter and he is in Ar. Counting from Sg to Ar,

we get a count of 5. Counting 5 signs from Ar, we get Le. A4 is in Le.

(5)  Fifth house is in Cp. Lord is Saturn and he is in Ar. Counting from Cp to Ar,
we get a count of 4. Counting 4 signs from Ar, we get Cn. However, this is in
the  7th  from  the  original  sign  (Cp).  So  we  take  the  10th  therefrom  (from  Cn)
and get Ar. A5 is in Ar.

  88

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(6)  Sixth house is in Aq. Lord is Saturn – he is stronger than Rahu, being with 2
other planets – and he is in Ar. Counting from Aq to Ar, we get a count of 3.
Counting 3 signs from Ar, we get Ge. A6 is in Ge.

(7)  Seventh house is in Pi. Lord is Jupiter and he is in Ar. Counting from Pi to Ar,

we get a count of 2. Counting 2 signs from Ar, we get Ta. A7 is in Ta.

(8)  Eighth house is in Ar. Lord is Mars and he is in Ar. Counting from Ar to Ar,
we get a count of 1. Counting 1 sign from Ar, we get Ar itself. However, this
is in the 1st from the original sign (Ar). So we take the 10th therefrom and get
Cp. A8 is in Cp.

(9)  Ninth house is in Ta. Lord is Venus and he is in Pi. Counting from Ta to Pi,
we get a count of 11. Counting 11 signs from Pi, we get Cp. A9 is in Cp.
(10)  Tenth house is in Ge. Lord is Mercury and he is in Pi. Counting from Ge to Pi,
we get a count of 10. Counting 10 signs from Pi, we get Sg. However, this is
in the 7th from the original sign (Ge). So we take the 10th therefrom (from Sg)
and get Vi. A10 is in Vi.

(11)  Eleventh house is in Cn. Lord is Moon and he is in Ge. Counting from Cn to
Ge, we get a count of 12. Counting 12 signs from Ge, we get Ta. A11 is in Ta.
(12)  Twelfth house is in Le. Lord is Sun and he is in Pi. Counting from Le to Pi,

we get a count of 8. Counting 8 signs from Pi, we get Li. UL is in Li.

Exercise 12:  Find arudha padas of all the 12 houses in Chart 2.

Hint:  Mars  is  with  2  other  planets  and  Ketu  is  with  only  one  planet.  So  Mars  is
stronger  than  Ketu  and  works  as  the  lord  of  Sc.  Saturn  is  alone  and  Rahu  is  with
another planet. So Rahu is stronger and works as the lord of Aq.

Chart 2

9.3  Use of Arudha Lagna

While  lagna  stands  for  true  self,  arudha  lagna  (AL)  stands  for  the  maya  associated
with self. It shows the how the native is perceived in the material world. It shows the
status of the native. A timid and confused individual may be perceived in the world
as a strong leader. In that case, that is the maya associated with his personality and
AL shows it.

Because arudha lagna deals with maya, illusions, perceptions and impressions, it is
very  important  in  judging  various  materialistic  things.  For  example,  Parasara  and

  90

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Jaimini  taught  that  the  11th  and  12th  houses  from  AL  show  financial  gains  and
expenditures. Natural malefics in the 3rd and 6th houses from AL show someone who
is  perceived  as  a  bold  person  who  hits  enemies  hard.  Since  such  impressions  are
usually  formed  about  materially  successful  people,  malefics  in  the  3rd  and  6th  from
AL  make  one  bold  and  materially  successful.  Natural  benefics  in  the  3rd  and  6th
houses  from  AL  make  one  very  gentle  and  restrained  in  public  behavior.  Such  a
person  does  not  fight  with  others  boldly.  This  combination  is  usually  found  in  the
charts of saints and saintly and mild-natured people.

The 10th house from lagna in D-10 shows one’s true conduct in society. It shows the
one’s career and the true nature of one’s karma (work). The 10th house from AL in
D-10  shows  perceptions  about  one’s  conduct  in  society.  It  deals  more  with  one’s
status in career.

9.4  Use of Bhava Arudhas

Arudha padas show the maya (illusion) of material world. Arudha pada of nth house
shows the maya associated with the matters signified by of nth house.

For  example,  1st  house  stands  for  self.  While  the  first  house  from  lagna  stands  for
true self, its arudha pada (AL) stands for the maya associated with self. It shows the
how the native is perceived in the material world. It shows the status of the native.

The 4th house in D-16 shows happiness from vehicle. It shows true happiness from a
vehicle.

One  may  be  very  happy  with  a  Bajaj  Chetak  (an  inexpensive  two-wheel  vehicle
popular in India) or even a bicycle and one owning three Mercedes Benz cars may be
unhappy  with  them  and  always  dreaming  of  owning  a  better  vehicle.  One’s  true
happiness from vehicle has nothing to do with the type of vehicle owned. However,
people perceive one with 3 Mercedes Benz cars as a happier person in the matter of
vehicle,  compared  to  a  Chetak  owner.  This  is  the  maya  associated  with  “happiness
from vehicle” in this material world. So this is shown by A4.

Benefics  influencing  the  4th  house  in  D-16  show  someone  who  is  happy  with  his
vehicle(s).  Benefics  influencing  A4  in  D-16  show  someone  who  is  perceived  to  be
happy  with  his  vehicle(s).  So  planets  influencing  A4  in  D-16  shed  light  on  the

Part 1: Chart Analysis

91

physical  vehicle  owned  by  a  person.  Someone  with  Venus  in  own  sign  in  A4  and
Saturn in 4th (in D-16) may own luxurious vehicles (i.e. perceived to be happy with
respect  to  vehicle)  but  not  be  happy.  Someone  with  Saturn  in  A4  and  Venus  and
Jupiter in 4th (in D-16) may own a small vehicle (i.e. perceived to be unhappy with
respect to vehicles), but be happy with it.

As shown above, 4th house in D-16 deals with happiness from vehicles. In D-24, 4th
house deals with learning and education. A4 in D-24 deals with the maya (illusion)
associated with learning. What is it?

If someone studied at IIT (a top engineering institute of India), people may think that
he  is  very  knowledgable.  If  someone  studied  at  an  obscure  university,  people  may
not  get  the  same  impression.  But  it  is  possible  that  people’s  perceptions  are  wrong
and the person who studied at IIT is less knowledgable.

So A4 in D-24 shows the school or university  and the environment in which one’s
learning takes place. Usually that decides what impression people form about one’s
learning.

Similarly,  A10  in  D-10  shows  the  maya  associated  with  one’s  karma  (action  –
career).  We  form  an  impression  about  one’s  career  based  on  the  place  and
environment where one’s work takes place. So A10 in D-10 shows one’s workplace.
One  with  Mars  in  A10  in  D-10  may  work  at  dynamic  places  or  engineering
companies. One with Jupiter in A10 in D-10 may work at a university or college or a
court of law or a temple.

One important arudha pada used in Jyotish is upapada lagna (UL) – the arudha pada
of  the  12th  house.  This  shows  one’s  marriage  and  spouse.  Planets  in  UL  show  the
kind of marriage one has and the kind of spouse one gets. For example, Mercury in
UL can show intelligent (when good) or indecisive (when bad) spouse. Ketu in UL
can show spiritual (when good) or short-tempered (when bad) spouse. Sun in UL can
show a charming spouse from a respectable family. It can also show an authoritative
spouse. Mars in UL may show a bold spouse (when good) and a quarrelsome spouse
(when bad).

The 8th house from UL  shows the longevity of  marriage  and the 2nd and 7th houses
from  UL  show  the  end  of  marriage.  Malefics  like  Mars,  Saturn  and  nodes  in  these
houses from UL can result in troubles for the marriage and even a divorce.

  92

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Nature of spouse and the length of the marriage are two different issues. If Mars and
Saturn are in UL and Jupiter is in the 8th from UL, it may show a long marriage to an
argumentative  and mean spouse.  If Jupiter is in  UL and Mars  and Saturn in the 8th
from it, one may have a noble spouse but the marital life will be very rough and there
can  even  be  a  divorce.  In  such  a  case,  propitiating  Saturn  and  Mars  can  help  (for
more, see the chapter on “Remedial Measures”).

The 7th house shows relations and A7 (darapada) shows the illusion associated with
them, i.e. the kind of people one usually interacts with. Based on the kind of people
one deals with, we perceive the nature of one’s relations. If one has a friend who is a
prostitute,  people  may  get  a  negative  impression  about  one’s  dealings.  If  one  has  a
friend  who  is  a  famous  film  star,  there  is  some  glamour  associated  with  one’s
relations. Thus darapada shows the kind of people one associates with and that plays
an  important  role  in  forming  people’s  impressions  about  one’s  relations.  In  D-10,
darapada may show professional associates. In D-24, it may show friends at college
or colleagues in the pursuit of knowledge. In D-20, it may show colleagues or friends
in religious activities.

The 3rd house shows one’s boldness. The 3rd house from lagna and the 3rd house from
Mars  show  one’s  true  boldness  and  the  3rd  house  from  AL  shows  how  bold  one  is
perceived.  In  addition,  A3  shows  the  maya  surrounding  one’s  boldness.  It  shows
what  drives  the  perceptions  of  people  about  one’s  boldness.  The  weapons  one
possesses may drive those perceptions and A3 may show one’s weapons.

The 3rd house also shows one’s communication skills. The 3rd house in D-24 (chart
of  learning  and  knowledge)  and  D-10  (achievements  in  society)  may  show  one’s
writing skills. A3 shows the maya associated with one’s writing skills. One may have
excellent writing skills, but not write any book. In such a case, people may not really
appreciate one’s writing skills. One may be an average writer, but end up writing 20
books.  In  such  a  case,  people  may  perceive  him  as  a  great  writer.  Thus  the  exact
books written by one decide the perceptions of the world about one’s writing skills.
So  A3  in  D-24  and  D-10  may  show  the  books  or  articles  written  by  him.  In  this
author’s D-10, for example, A3 is in Pisces. This can mean that he will be known for
some books on saattwik and traditional subjects and astrology certainly fits the bill.

Let  us  take  the  5th  house  as  another  example.  It  shows  intelligence,  following,
devotion  etc.  The  5th  house  in  D-20,  the  chart  of  religious  activities,  shows  one’s

Part 1: Chart Analysis

93

devotion (bhakti) in religious activities. A5 in D-20 shows the things based on which
the  world  forms  an  impression  about  one’s  devotion.  The  mantras  one  recites,  the
poojas  and  the  religious  rituals  one  performs  control  the  impression  of  the  world
about one’s devotion in religious matters. So A5 shows them.

The 5th house in D-10, the chart of career, shows the following one has. The world
forms  an  impression  about  one’s  following  based  on  the  power  wielded  by  one.  A
political leader in a position of power is assumed to have a lot of following. So A5
can show the trappings of power enjoyed by one. It can also show awards.

In  D-24,  the  chart  of  learning,  the  5th  house  may  show  intelligence.  A5  in  D-24
shows  the  things  based  on  which  the  world  forms  an  impression  about  one’s
intelligence  in  learning.  These  impressions  are  usually  formed  based  on  one’s
performances in examinations, one’s scores in tests and one’s academic distinctions.
So that is what A5 in D-24 shows.

Similarly, the 9th house shows one’s fortune. In D-24, it may show fortune related to
learning.  It  can  show  the  guidance  received  by  one  (i.e.  guru  –  teacher).  But  the
world  forms  an  impression  about  one’s  fortune  in  learning,  based  on  the  degrees
received by one. One with an advanced degree is assumed to be more fortunate with
respect  to  learning  than  one  with  a  simple  degree.  So  A9  can  show  one’s  higher
degrees.

In this manner, intelligent and blessed students can clearly understand the meanings
of  various  arudha  padas  in  various  divisional  charts.  One  cannot  become  a  good
Vedic astrologer by memorizing a lot of tables. One needs to understand the basics
clearly and apply them intelligently.

All the principles of Vedic astrology should be understood and applied in the context
of  “desa”  (country  –  place),  “kaala”  (time  –  age)  and  “paatra”  (nature  and  class  of
the  persons  involved).  When  we  interpret  arudha  padas,  we  are  talking  about  the
things based on which the world forms an impression about an aspect of the native.
The things that drive the world’s perceptions can be different based on which world
we are living in. They vary significantly from one place to another, from one age to
another  and  from  one  class  to  another.  Intelligent  use  of  arudhas  requires  an
astrologer to understand the world that the native lives in.

9.5  Computation of Graha Arudhas

Just as arudha padas of all houses (bhavas) are defined, arudha padas of all the nine
planets  (grahas)  are  also  defined  and  they  are  called  graha  arudhas.  They  are
computed as follows:

(1) Take the sign containing the planet of interest in the divisional chart of interest.

(2) Find the sign owned by that planet.

NOTE: Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn own 2 signs each.  In
their  case,  take  the  stronger  sign  owned  by  the  planet.  The  chapter  on
“Strength of Planets and Rasis” will explain the rules used in comparing
the strengths of signs. Take the two signs, apply those rules and find the
stronger sign.

(3) Count  signs  from  the  sign  containing  the  planet  of  interest  to  the  stronger  sign
owned  by  it.  Counting  is  in  the  zodiacal  direction  always.  For  example,  if  the
planet we are interested in is Sun and he is Gemini, we count signs from Gemini
to Leo and get 3.

(4) Count  the  same  number  of  signs  from  the  stronger  sign  owned  and  find  the
ending sign. In the above example, we count 3 signs from Leo and we end up in
Libra.

(5) Exception: If the sign found thus in step (4) is in the 1st or 7th from the original
sign containing the planet, then we take the 10th sign from the sign found in step
(4). Otherwise we don’t make any change.

(6) The resulting sign contains the arudha pada of the planet of interest.

Example 30: Find the arudha padas of all the planets in Chart 1.

(1) Sun is in Pi. From Pi, Sun’s own sign Le is the 6th sign. Counting 6 signs from

Le, we get Cp. So Cp contains Sun’s arudha pada.

(2) Moon is in Ge. From Ge, Moon’s own sign Cn is the 2nd sign. Counting 2 signs

from Cn, we get Le. So Le contains Moon’s arudha pada.

(3) Mars is in Ar. He owns 2 signs – Ar and Sc. Ar is stronger as it contains more
planets. From Ar, Ar is the 1st sign. Counting 1 sign from Ar, we get Ar. Because

Part 1: Chart Analysis

95

this is the 1st house from the sign containing Mars, we take the 10th therefrom and
get Cp. So Cp contains the arudha pada of Mars.

(4) Mercury is in Pi. He owns 2 signs – Ge and Vi. Ge is stronger as it has Moon and
Vi is empty. From Pi, Ge is the 4th sign. Counting 4 signs from Ge, we  get Vi.
Since Vi is the 7th from Pi, we take the 10th from Vi and get Ge. So Ge contains
Mercury’s arudha pada.

(5) Jupiter is in Ar. He owns 2 signs – Sg and Pi. Pi is stronger as it has 3 planets and
Sg is empty. From Ar, Pi is the 12th sign. Counting 12 signs from Pi, we get Aq.
So Aq contains Jupiter’s arudha pada.

(6) Venus is in Pi. He owns 2 signs – Ta and Li. Li is stronger (it will become clear
after reading the chapter on “Strength of Planets and Rasis”.). From Pi, Li is the
8th sign. Counting 8 signs from Li, we get Ta. So Ta contains the arudha pada of
Venus.

(7) Saturn is in Ar. He owns 2 signs – Aq and Cp. Cp is stronger as it has Ketu and
Aq is empty. From Ar, Cp is the 10th sign. Counting 10 signs from Cp, we get Li.
Since Li is the 7th from Ar, we take the 10th from Li and get Cn. So Cn contains
Saturn’s arudha pada.

(8) Rahu  is  in  Cn.  From  Cn,  Rahu’s  own  sign  Aq  is  the  8th  sign.  Counting  8  signs

from Aq, we get Vi. So Vi contains Rahu’s arudha pada.

(9) Ketu is in Cp. From Cp, Ketu’s own sign Sc is the 11th sign. Counting 11 signs

from Sc, we get Vi. So Vi contains Ketu’s arudha pada.

Exercise 13: Find arudha padas of all the nine planets in Chart 2.

Hint: Out of the 2 signs owned by Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, Ar, Ta,
Vi, Sg and Aq are stronger (respectively).

NOTE: In divisional charts in which Ketu is in the 7th from Rahu, his maya (arudha
pada) is with Rahu’s maya. In divisional charts in which Rahu and Ketu are together,
their  mayas  are  in  opposite  rasis.  The  readers  may  ponder  over  the  philosophical
significance of this.

9.6  Use of Graha Arudhas

Just as arudha padas of various houses show the illusions of the world related to the
matters  signified  by  various  houses,  arudha  padas  of  various  planets  show  the

  96

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

illusions  of  the  native  related  to  the  matters  signified  by  various  planets.  Houses
show  various  aspects  of  the  person’s  life  and  their  arudhas  show  how  they  are
perceived  in  the  world.  Planets  show  various  persons,  forces  and  situations  that
impact  various  aspects  of  a  person’s  life  and  their  arudhas  show  the  related
perceptions by the person.

Just as the perceptions of the world about a native can be totally different from the
reality,  perceptions  of  a  native  about  himself,  about  the  world  and  about  the
situations  that  (s)he  goes  through  can  be  totally  different  from  the  reality.  Graha
arudhas throw light on these perceptions.

Example 31:
Let us consider Moon’s periods for the native in Chart 1. Because Moon is in the 10th
house, his periods will give important developments related to career. Because Moon
owns the 2nd from AL and occupies AL, status of the native in the eyes of people will
increase in Moon’s periods. However, Moon’s arudha pada is in the 12th from lagna.
This will make the native feel frustrated. The native will be unhappy and under the
illusion  that  things  are  going  bad  for  him.  But  people  will  think  that  his  status  is
increasing and there will be some good developments in career in reality.

Example 32:
Let us consider India’s Prime Minister Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s rasi chart given in Chart
3. Jupiter’s period ran in 1980’s and 1990’s. With Jupiter in the 2nd house from AL,
his dasa can give a rise in material fortune. With Jupiter being a functional benefic
for  Scorpio  lagna  and  occupying  a  quadrant,  Jupiter  dasa  should  give  comforts  in
reality. However, Jupiter’s arudha pada is in Libra, the 12th house from lagna. This
can make the native feel unhappy, uncomfortable and alienated. Graha arudhas show
how the native feels.

In Rahu’s sub-period in Jupiter’s period, the native became  India’s Prime Minister.
Rahu  is  in  the  8th  house  from  lagna  and  his  periods  should  cause  discomfort,
frustration and health troubles in reality. However, being a natural malefic in the 6th
house from AL, Rahu can give material success and victory over enemies and rivals.
That  is  how  the  world  perceives  him.  Rahu’s  arudha  pada  is  in  Libra,  i.e.  the  12th
house from lagna. This can again make the native frustrated and unhappy. However,
if we are interested in the native’s material success, Rahu’s 6th house placement from
AL is the most important factor and success is ensured.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

97

Chart 3

Example 33:
Consider the native of Chart 4. Let us see what results Ketu’s period can give him.
Ketu  is  in  lagna.  Ketu  in  lagna  can  make  one  spiritual.  In  Ketu  dasa,  this  native
joined a spiritual movement and started meditating regularly.

From  AL,  Ketu  is  in  3rd.  As  a  natural  malefic  in  the  3rd  from  AL,  Ketu  can  give
boldness and material success. He was indeed materially successful.

How did the native feel in this dasa? Look at Ketu’s arudha pada. It is in Capricorn,
the 5th house from lagna. Ketu in 5th gives proficiency in mathematics  and abstract
analysis  and makes one  do intelligent work. This may  be how the native  felt about
his activities in that period.

In  this  manner,  we  can  use  graha  arudha  to  understand  the  illusions  the  native  is
under.  Illusion  should  not  be  looked  at  as  a  bad  word  here.  We  are  all  constantly

  98

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

under  illusion.  Basically  graha  arudhas  show  the  perceptions  of  the  native.  They
show how the native feels.

Judging  the  positions  of  planets  with  respect  to  lagna,  we  can  understand  the  real
situation. Judging the positions of planets with respect to AL, we can understand the
perceptions of people and the situation at a materialistic level. Judging the positions
of  the  arudha  padas  of  planets  with  respect  to  lagna,  we  can  understand  how  the
native  perceives  the  situation  and  how  the  native  feels.  Unless  we  understand  this
aspect correctly, we cannot offer good astrological counselling. When we counsel a
person, we must understand how the person feels and what drives those feelings. So,
each of these 3 aspects of chart analysis is important in its own right. A good student
of Vedic astrology will master all the 3 aspects.

9.7  Summary

Arudha  pada  of  a  house  shows  the  maya  surrounding  the  matters  signified  by  that
house.  It  shows  the  factors  based  on  which  the  impressions  of  people  are  formed.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

99

Arudha lagna or AL shows people’s impressions about a native. It shows one’s status
in  the  material  world.  Darapada  or  A7  shows  one’s  relationships.  Upapada  (UL)
shows  one’s  marriage  and  spouse.  A4  in  D-16  shows  one’s  vehicle.  A4  in  D-24
shows one’s school or college or university (place of education). A10 in D-10 shows
one’s workplace.

Arudha  padas  of  planets  show  the  perceptions  of  the  native  about  the  world,  about
himself or herself and about the situations developing in his or her life.

Analysis of the positions of planets with respect to lagna shows reality. Analysis of
the  positions  of  planets  with  respect  to  AL  shows  perceptions  of  the  world  and
material  situation.  Analysis  of  individual  bhava  arudhas  throws  light  on  various
things  based  on  which  world  forms  impressions  about  a  native.  Analysis  of  the
positions of the arudha padas of planets with respect to lagna shows the perceptions
of the native.

10.  Aspects and Argalas

10.1  Introduction

Planets  aspect  other  planets,  rasis  and  houses  in  astrology.  A  planet  aspecting  a
house or a planet has some influence on the matters signified by that house or planet.
The nature of the influence exerted and the degree to which that influence succeeds
depends on the individual situation.

There  are  2  kinds  of  aspects:  (1)  graha  drishti  and  (2)  rasi  drishti.  Drishti  means
aspect.  Each  planet  aspects  certain  houses  from  it  with  graha  drishti  (planetary
aspect). The houses aspected are fixed based on the planet. In addition, rasis aspect
each other and a planet aspects the rasis aspected by the rasi occupied by it. This is
called rasi drishti (sign aspect).

10.2  Graha Drishri

All planets aspect the 7th house from them. For example, Sun in Ta aspects Sc. Mars
in  Ge  aspects  Sg.  Moon  in  Le  aspects  Aq.  Jupiter  in  Pi  aspects  Vi.  Saturn  in  Cp
aspects Cn. Find the 7th house from the planet and the planet aspects that house.

In addition, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn have special aspects:

•  Jupiter aspects the 5th and 9th houses from him, in addition to the 7th house.
•  Mars aspects the 4th and 8th houses from him, in addition to the 7th house.
•  Saturn aspects the 3rd and 10th houses from him, in addition to the 7th house.

We  can  decide  the  signs  and  houses  aspected  by  a  planet  as  above.  If  any  planet
occupies the aspected houses, then the planet is also aspected. For example, Jupiter
in  Ta  will  aspect  Saturn  in  Cp,  because  Cp  is  the  9th  house  from  Ta  and  Jupiter
aspects the 9th from him.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

101

Example 34:
Let us say Jupiter is in Ge, Mars in Le and Saturn in Sg. Jupiter in Ge will aspect the
5th, 7th and 9th from Ge. So Jupiter in Ge will aspect Li, Sg and Aq. Mars in Le will
aspect the 4th, 7th and 8th from Le. So Mars in Le will aspect Sc, Aq and Pi. Saturn in
Sg will aspect the 3rd, 7th and 10th from Sg. So Saturn in Sg will aspect Aq, Ge and
Vi.

Look  at  a  few  charts  and  figure  out  which  planets  are  aspecting  which  houses  and
which planets are aspecting which planets. With experience, you can become good at
it and this is an important skill required in interpreting charts.

10.3  Rasi Drishti

  102

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Rasis aspect other rasis based on the following rules:

•  A movable rasi aspects all fixed rasis except the one adjacent to it.
•  A fixed rasi aspects all movable rasis except the one adjacent to it.
•  A dual rasi aspects all other dual rasis.

For  example,  Ar  is  a  movable  sign.  It  aspects  all  the  fixed  signs  except  the  one
adjacent to it, i.e. Ta. So Ar aspects Le, Sc and Aq.

Ta is a fixed sign. It aspects all the movable signs except the one adjacent to it, i.e.
Ar. So Ta aspects Cn, Li and Cp.

Ge is a dual sign. It aspects all other dual signs. So Ge aspects Vi, Sg and Pi.

Figure 2: Rasi Aspects

It  may  be  noted  that  sign  Y  will  aspect  sign  X  if  sign  X  aspects  sign  Y.  A  visual
representation of rasi aspects is given in Figure 2. A line is drawn between every pair
of  signs  that  aspect  each  other.  A  planet  aspects  the  signs  aspected  by  the  sign  it
occupies. It also aspects the houses and planets in those signs. This aspect is called

Part 1: Chart Analysis

103

rasi drishti (sign  aspect). For example, a planet in  Libra  will aspect the houses and
planets in Aq, Ta and Le.

Exercise  15:  Find  the  rasis,  houses  and  planets  aspected  with  rasi  drishti  by  Sun,
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu in Chart 5.

10.4  Graha Drishti vs Rasi Drishti

A simple analogy will make things clearer. Look at planets as people. Let us take a
priest  as  an  example.  Will  he  have  some  influence  on  his  neighbors?  Probably.
Because  he  lives  there,  gets  up  early  in  the  morning  and  recites  mantras,  it  may
influence his neighbors also. Because of the houses they live in, his neighbors come
under  his  influence.  How  pious  and  god-fearing  his  influence  makes  his  neighbors
depends  on  other  factors.  If  one  of  the  neighbors  is  a  dreaded  criminal,  he  is  not
going to be influenced.

Let us take a dreaded criminal as another example. He may also have an influence on
his  neighbors.  Youngsters  living  in  the  neighboring  houses  may  enter  the  criminal
world because of him. Ladies in the neighboring houses may stay inside their houses
at night and not come out after certain time.

Thus  we  are  influenced  by  people  in  neighboring  houses.  Influence  exerted  by
planets by rasi drishti is similar to this influence.

Compared  to  this  limited  influence  on  the  neighbors,  a  priest  may  have  greater
influence in the matters of the nearby temple where he works. He may have a lot of
influence  on  devotees  who  come  to  visit  the  temple  and  who  approach  him  for
performing poojas, homas etc. Influence exerted with graha drishti is similar to this
influence.

Influence exerted by rasi drishti is due to the sign a planet is in. This is analogous to
the  influence  people  exert  on  their  neighbors.  All  planets  in  a  sign  will  have  rasi
drishti  on  the  same  signs,  just  as  people  living  in  the  same  house  see  the  same
neighbors  everyday  and  exert  some  influence  over  the  same  neighbors.  But  the
influence they exert may differ. A priest may tell his neighbors to pray to God. His
movie-loving  brother  living  in  the  same  house  may  talk  the  same  neighbors  into

  104

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

watching all the movies of a particular actress. Thus, planets in the same sign exert
influence on the same houses and planets through rasi drishti, but the nature of the
influence varies from planet to planet.

Influence exerted by graha drishti is due to the inherent nature of a planet. Different
planets in the same sign may aspect different houses and planets with graha drishti.
A priest may have great influence over the devotees at the temple he works at and his
movie-loving  brother  living  in  the  same  house  may  have  great  influence  over  his
movie-loving classmates and co-members of the fan club of an actress, of which he
is  president.  Similarly,  planets  in  the  same  sign  may  influence  planets  in  different
houses. However, everyone in a house may  have a strong influence over friends of
the family who visit the house frequently. Similarly, all planets aspect the 7th house
from them and have an influence over it.

10.5  Argala (Intervention)

In addition to the influence caused by planets with graha drishti and rasi drishti, there
is another influence called “argala”.

Argala  is  a  very  important  concept  in  Vedic  astrology.  Literally  speaking,  argala
means “a bolt”. Argala on a house shows the influences that intervene in its affairs,
decide some parts of it and close the bolt on it, so to speak. Planet having rasi drishti
have a small influence. Planets having graha drishti have a more concrete influence.
Planets  with  argala  simply  decide  some  parts  of  the  matter  signified  by  the  house.
The influence caused by argala is decisive.

A planet or house in the 2nd, 4th and 11th houses from a planet or house causes
primary argala on the latter. Argala by a benefic planet is called a “subhaargala”
(benefic  intervention)  and  argala  by  a  malefic  planet  is  called  a  “paapaargala”
(malefic  intervention).  This  simple  concept  can  be  better  appreciated  if  some
examples are given.

The 4th house stands for education. The 2nd, 4th and 11th from the 4th house are 5th, 7th
and 2nd houses respectively. One’s intelligence (5th), interaction with others (7th) and
and overall character and samskara (2nd) make or break one education. If Jupiter is in
5th  house,  he  will  give  intelligence  and  his  subhargala  (benefic  intervention)  on  4th
will  help  one’s  education.  If  Rahu  is  in  5th  house,  his  papargala  (malefic

Part 1: Chart Analysis

105

intervention)  on  4th  will  cause  obstacles  in  one’s  education  by  way  of  poor
intelligence.  Similarly,  benefics  and  malefics  in  the  houses  causing  argala  cause
good  and  bad  intervention.  Basically,  the  point  is  that  intelligence,  interaction  and
samskara are the things that decide one’s education. They have a decisive role.

Let  us  take  another  example.  Short  journeys  are  seen  from  the  3rd  house.  What  are
the  things  necessary  for  a  journey?  One  needs  a  vehicle  (4th).  One  may  need
someone  to  serve  one  by  driving  the  vehicle.  Servants  are  seen  from  6th.  So,  no
wonder  the  4th  and  6th  houses  cause  argala  on  the  3rd  house,  being  the  2nd  and  4th
from it respectively! If one has papargala on 3rd from 4th, it may show trouble to the
journey  because  of  the  vehicle.  If  one  has  papargala  on  3rd  from  6th,  it  may  show
trouble to the journey because of the driver.

Let us take another example. Domestic harmony, comfort, well-being and happiness
are  seen  from  the  4th  house.  What  are  the  things  that  can  make  or  break  domestic
harmony?  Of  course,  wife,  children  and  other  family  members!  Each  of  them  can
intervene in one’s domestic harmony. No wonder the 5th, 7th and 2nd houses have an
argala on the 4th house (being the 2nd, 4th and 11th respectively from the 4th house)! If
a malefic in 5th has papargala on 4th, it may show domestic clashes and lack of sukha
(comfort/happiness)  on  account  of  a  child.  If  a  benefic  in  7th  has  subhargala  on  on
4th, it may show domestic happiness due to a caring partner.

Apart from the 2nd, 4th and 11th houses from a house, the 5th house from a house has a
secondary argala on it. In the case of learning, argala of 8th house on 4th (8th is the 5th
from 4th) shows the influence of hard work in learning. Hard work is another decider.
In the case of journey, argala of 7th house on 3rd house (7th is the 5th from 3rd) shows
the influence of partners in a journey.

10.6  Virodhargala (Obstruction)

Virodhargala shows the obstruction of argala. Planets and houses in the 12th, 10th, 3rd
and 9th houses from a house or planet cause virodhargala and obstruct the argala on it
from  the  2nd,  4th,  11th  and  5th  houses  from  it  (respectively).  For  example,  let  us  say
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are in Ge, Pi, Ar and Vi respectively. Saturn is in
the  4th  from  Mercury  and  Ge  and  he  causes  argala  on  them.  With  Saturn  being  a
malefic,  this  is  a  paapaargala  (malefic  intervention).  But  Jupiter  is  in  the  10th  from
Mercury and Ge. So he obstructs Saturn’s argala and averts the troubles. Venus is in

  106

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

the 11th from Mercury and Ge and so he causes argala on them. With Venus being a
benefic, it is a subhaargala (benefic intervention). If Le (3rd from Ge) is empty, this
argala is unobstructed.

NOTE:  If  a  sign  contains  Ketu,  argalas  and  virodhargalas  on  it  are  counted  anti-
zodiacally. For example, let us say Ketu is in Vi. Then Le, Ge, Sc and Ta are the 2nd,
4th,  11th  and  5th  from  Vi  (counted  anti-zodiacally)  and  planets  in  those  signs  cause
argala on Vi and on the planets in Vi. Virodhargala is also counted similarly.

Exercise 16: Find the planets causing argalas and virodhargalas on all the 12 houses
in Chart 5.

There  is  a  special  principle  regarding  the  3rd  house  obstruction.  If  there  are  several
malefics  in  the  3rd  house  from  a  house  or  a  planet,  they  cause  argala  instead  of
virodhargala on that house or planet.

10.7  Use of Argala

Depending on the matter of interest, take the relevant house or the relevant karaka.
Find  argalas  and  virodhargalas  on  it.  If  there  are  both,  see  if  more  planets  cause
argala  or  virodhargala.  If  they  are  caused  by  the  same  number  of  planets,  compare
the  strengths  and  decide  whether  argala  dominates  or  virodhargala.  Based  on  the
signs, houses and planets involved, guess the meaning of the argala or virodhargala.

Argala from the 2nd house shows the basic ingredient for the sustenance of a matter.
For example, the 2nd house shows food and it is a basic ingredient for the sustenance
of  self  (1st).  The  5th  house  shows  intelligence  and  it  is  a  basic  ingredient  for  the
sustenance of learning (4th).

Argala  from  the  4th  house  shows  the  basic  factor  that  drives  the  mood,  state  and
progress  of  a  matter.  For  example,  the  4th  house  shows  comfort  and  it  drives  the
mood  and  state  of  self  (1st).  The  7th  house  shows  interaction  and  that  drives  one’s
learning (4th).

Part 1: Chart Analysis

107

Argala  from  the  11th  house  shows  the  catalyst  that  can  result  in  gains  for  a  matter.
For  example,  the  2nd  house  shows  character,  grooming  and  samskara  and  it  is  a
catalyst in the process of learning (4th).

Secondary  argala  from  the  5th  house  shows  the  additional  contributing  factors.  For
example, the 5th house shows emotional situation and that contributes to the state of
self (1st). The 8th house shows hard work and that contributes to one’s learning (4th).

Using the above guidelines, we can understand the meaning of argalas on houses and
karakas.

Example  35:  Consider  India’s  former  Prime  Minister  Sri  P.V.  Narasimha  Rao’s
chart  shown  in  Chart  6.  Let  us  find  the  planets  having  a  decisive  influence  on  his
livelihood and karma (action) in society.

Saturn  is  the  significator  of  livelihood  and  karma.  Argalas  on  him  denote  decisive
influences  on  livelihood  and  karma.  Mercury,  Mars  and  Sun  have  an  argala  on

  108

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Saturn,  as  they  are  in  the  11th  from  him.  Mercury’s  influence  indicates  writing  and
scholarliness. Sun and Mars suggest politics.

Chart 7

Example  36:  Consider  the  chart  shown  in  Chart  7.  It  belongs  to  well-known
Hollywood  actor  and  former  US  President  Ronald  Reagan.  Let  us  find  the  planets
having  a  decisive  influence  on  his  livelihood  and  karma.  The  only  planet  with  an
argala on Saturn is Venus in the 11th from Saturn. Thus he was an actor, entertainer
and  a  showman.  In  Example  35,  Sun  has  an  argala  on  Saturn  and  politics  was  the
native’s livelihood. In this chart, on the other hand, Sun has no argala and the native
entered politics late. His political power is indicated by Sun’s unobstructed argala on
GL.

Exercise 17: Try to guess the nature of livelihood and karma (action) of the native in
Chart 8. Don’t look at the answer until you think a lot.

Hint:  Being  in  own  house,  Venus  dominates  over  Jupiter  and  Mercury.  Being  the
most  advanced  planet,  Mercury  is  also  strong.  Mars  dominates  over  Sun  and  Ketu,
being in own house and being more advanced than Ketu – the other owner of Sc.

Exercise 17:

Saturn is the significator of livelihood and karma. He shows what kind of activity a
native engages in. Being in a watery sign, he shows something flexible and fluid. By
studying the argalas on him, we can see the decisive influences on the nature of his
karma.

Venus  is  in  the  4th  from  Saturn.  His  argala  on  Saturn  shows  creative  and  aesthetic
work (e.g. actor, poet etc). Though Venus is in own sign, Mercury is more advanced
and Mercury also has influence over Saturn through his argala. Mercury and Venus
together show intelligent and logical work of an aesthetic nature. Being the 4th house
argala, this influence is the basic driving factor of the native’s karma.

Mars is very strong in the 5th house from Saturn and he also has a secondary argala.
Martian influence gives discipline, systematicity and enterprise. He can denote some
design work. Mars engineers things.

Rahu is in the 11th from Saturn and he has a malefic argala on Saturn. Rahu stands
for  pathbreaking  innovation  and  also  shady  elements  of  society.  His  11th  house
argala can denote gains in his livelihood with those factors working as catalysts.

The final answer: The native was a very famous and successful fashion designer. He
had mafia connections. He was finally shot dead.

11.  Yogas

11.1  Introduction

We  have  seen  in  previous  chapters  the  use  of  divisional  charts,  houses,  karakas,
arudha padas, aspects and argalas. Using all these tools, we can interpret charts and
draw various conclusions about a native’s fortune.

In  addition  to  these  general  guidelines,  there  are  several  specific  combinations  that
give  specific  results.  These  are  very  important  and  called  “Yogas”.  Readers  are
advised  to  refer  to  classics  such  as  “Brihat  Parasara  Hora  Sastram”  and  acquaint
themselves  with  as  many  yogas  as  possible.  Dr.  B.V.  Raman’s  “Three  Hundred
Important Combinations” is an excellent compendium on yogas.

Some  software  programs  list  the  yogas  present  in  a  chart.  However,  they  are
sometimes erroneous and one should be familiar with important yogas and be able to
judge  yogas  by  oneself,  without  relying  on  software.  Many  yogas  are  applicable  in
divisional  charts.  When  we  use  yogas  in  divisional  charts,  we  should  interpret  the
results ascribed to a yoga based on the matters signified by the divisional chart.

A  few  key  yogas  will  be  listed  in  this  chapter,  but  the  reader  is  urged  to  do  more
reading. In this book, yogas are divided into the following classes for convenience:

•  Ravi Yogas (solar combinations)
•  Chandra Yogas (lunar combinations)
•  Mahaapurusha Yogas (combinations producing 5 kinds of great men)
•  Naabhasa Yogas (classified celestial combinations)
•  Other Popular Yogas
•  Raaja Yogas (combinations giving power)
•  Raaja Sambandha Yogas (combinations for association with kings)
•  Dhana Yogas (combinations giving wealth)
•  Daridra Yogas (combinations giving poverty)

113

11.2  Ravi Yogas

Ravi yogas are the solar combinations. There are several yogas based on Sun.

Because Mercury and Venus are with Sun or a sign away from him most of the time,
the following yogas are very common in rasi chart. However, they are less common
in divisional charts. One can apply these yogas in D-9 and D-10 in particular.

11.2.1  Vesi Yoga

Definition: If there is a planet other than Moon in the 2nd house from Sun, then this
yoga  is  present.  For  example,  if  Sun  is  in  Gemini  and  Jupiter  and  Mercury  are  in
Cancer, then this yoga is present.

Results:  One  born  with  this  yoga  has  a  balanced  outlook.  He  is  truthful,  tall  and
sluggish. He is happy and comfortable even with little wealth.

11.2.2  Vosi Yoga

Definition: If there is a planet other than Moon in the 12th house from Sun, then this
yoga is present. For example, if Sun is in Aries and Jupiter and Venus are in Pisces,
then this yoga is present.

Results: One born with this yoga is skillful, charitable, famous, learned and strong.

11.2.3  Ubhayachara Yoga

Definition: If there are planets other than Moon in the 2nd and 12th houses from Sun,
then this yoga is present. For example, if Sun is in Cancer, Mars is in Leo and Venus
is in Gemini, then this yoga is present.

Results: One born with this yoga has all comforts. He is a king or an equal.

11.2.4  Budha-Aaditya Yoga (Nipuna Yoga)

  114

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Definition:  Budha  means  Mercury,  Aaditya  means  Sun  and  yoga  means
togetherness. If Sun and Mercury are together (in one sign), this yoga is present.

Results: One born with this yoga is intelligent and skillful in all works. He is well-
known, respected and happy. Nipuna means an expert.

Note:  If  Mercury  is  too  close  to  Sun,  he  is  combust  (asta  or  astangata).  Yogas
formed  by  combust  planets  lose  some  of  their  power  to  do  good.  This  yoga  is  the
most powerful in divisional charts like D-10. In rasi chart also, it can give results if
Mercury is not combust. Suppose someone has Sun and Mercury together in Leo in
D-10. Then that person has a powerful Budha-Aditya yoga in career. The results will
be felt throughout one’s life and the periods of Sun, Mercury and Leo will give those
results in particular.

11.3  Chandra Yogas

Chandra yogas are the lunar combinations. There are several yogas based on Moon.

General Guidelines:

(1)  If  Moon  is  in  a  quadrant  from  Sun,  then  one  may  possess  little  wealth,
intelligence and skills. If Moon is in a panapara from Sun, then one may possess
average wealth, intelligence and skills. If Moon is in an apoklima from Sun, then
one may possess a lot of wealth, intelligence and skills.

(2)  If Moon is in own navamsa or that of an adhimitra (good friend), that is good. In
such  a  situation,  aspect  of  Jupiter  on  Moon  beings  wealth  and  comforts  in  the
case of daytime birth (respectively). The same result is given by Venusian aspect
on Moon in the case of night birth. On the other hand, Jupiter’s aspect on Moon
in a night birth and Venusian aspect on Moon in a daytime birth are detrimental
to one’s wealth and comforts.

(3)  If all the natural benefics occupy upachayas (3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th) from Moon,
one has great wealth. If two benefics occupy upachayas from Moon, the native
has medium wealth.  If only one benefic occupies an upachaya from Moon, the
native has little wealth.

bad yoga is present. For example, if lagna is in Taurus, Moon is in Virgo, no planets
other than Sun in Leo, Virgo and Libra and no planets in Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and
Aquarius, then this yoga is present.

  116

yogas give the combinations that produce 5 kinds of great persons.

There  are  5  basic  elements  of  which  this  universe  is  made  of.  These  are  called
pancha bhootas (five existences) or pancha tattvas (five natures). They are:

•  Agni tattva (fiery nature)
•  Bhoo tattva (earthy nature)
•  Vaayu tattva (airy nature)
•  Jala tattva (watery nature)
•  Aakaasa tattva (ethery nature)

11.5.1  Aasraya Yogas

enemy’s house, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is famous, wealthy

31 Kartari literally means “scissors”. The 12th and 2nd houses from a house cast kartari on it. If the 2nd
and 12th from a house have benefics, it is said to have a subha (benefic) kartari. Malefics in the same
places  cause  paapa  (malefic)  kartari.  Subha  kartari  on  any  house  does  good  to  the  matters  of  that
house and paapa kartari does harm. Subha kartari and paapa kartari are also known as “subha kartari
yoga” and “paapa kartari yoga” and they can be seen with reference to any house or planet.

and intelligent. He has great character and he is liked by kings. For virtuousness and
ever-lasting fame, this is a key yoga.

Some  authors  consider  Gaja-Kesari  yoga  to  be  present  even  when  Jupiter  is  in  a
quadrant  from  lagna  and  not  Moon.  If  he  is  strong,  this  yoga  can  be  present  even
without a benefic’s aspect or conjunction.

Guru-Mangala Yoga: If Jupiter and Mars are together or in the 7th house from each
other, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is righteous and energetic.
His energies are channelled in dharmic paths.

Amala  Yoga:  If  there  are  only  natural  benefics  in  the  10th  house  from  lagna  or
Moon, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga has ever-lasting fame. He is
respected by kings. He has luxuries and he is virtuous. He helps others. Amala means
pure. Because the 10th house shows one conduct in society, situation of only benefics
there makes one’s conduct in the society very pure.

Parvata Yoga: If (1) quadrants are occupied only by benefics and (2) the 7th and 8th
houses are either vacant or occupied only by benefics,  then this yoga is present. One
born  with  this  yoga  is  fortunate,  eloquent,  famous,  charitable,  easy-going  and  likes
humour. Parvata means a mountain.

Kaahala Yoga: If (1) the 4th lord and Jupiter32 are in mutual quadrants and (2) lagna
lord is strong, then this yoga is present. Alternately, this yoga is present if the 4th lord
is  exalted  or  in  own  sign  and  the  10th  lord  joins  him.  One  born  with  this  yoga  is
strong, bold, cunning and leads a large army. He owns a few villages. Kaahala means
excessive. It also means mischievous.

Chaamara Yoga: If the lagna lord is exalted in a quadrant with Jupiter’s aspect or
two benefics join in 7th, 9th or 10th, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga
is  a  king  or  someone  respected  by  kings.  He  is  long-lived,  scholarly,  eloquent  and
learned in many arts. Chaamara means something akin to the plume on the head of a
horse. By waving it, servants give relief to kings from heat (like a fan). It basically
stands for the trappings of power.

Sankha  Yoga:  If  (1)  lagna  lord  is  strong  and  (2)  5th  and  6th  lords  are  in  mutual

and 10th lord are together in a movable sign and (2) the 9th lord is strong. One born

quadrants. One born with this yoga is blessed with wealth, spouse and children. He
can  be  a  king.  He  has  fame  and  character.  He  is  virtuous  and  religious.  He  enjoys
pleasures. Bheri means a kettledrum.

Mridanga  Yoga:  If  (1)  there  are  planets  in  own  and  exaltation  signs  in  quadrants

instrument popular in south India.

Sreenaatha Yoga: If (1) the 7th lord is exalted in 10th33 and (2) 10th lord is with 9th
lord, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga becomes a great king equal to
Indra  –  king  of  gods.  Sreenaatha  means  the  lord  of  great  wealth  and  prosperity.  It
also means Vishnu.

Matsya Yoga:  If (1) benefics are in lagna and 9th, (2) some planets are in 5th, and,
(3)  malefics  are  in  chaturasras  (4th  and  8th  houses),  then  this  yoga  is  present.  One
born  with  this  yoga  becomes  an  astrologer  or  a  seer.  He  is  a  personification  of
kindness,  character  and  intelligence.  He  is  strong  and  good-looking.  He  is  famous

this  yoga  becomes  a  king.  He  has  piety  and  character.  He  is  happy,  helpful  and
famous. Koorma means a tortoise.

33 If this is to be applied strictly, 7th lord can be exalted in 10th only for Sagittarius lagna.

Khadga  Yoga:  If  (1)  the  2nd  lord  is  in  the  9th  house,  (2)  the  9th  lord  is  in  the  2nd
house, and, (3) lagna lord is in a quadrant or a trine, then this  yoga is present. One
born with this yoga is skillful, wealthy, learned, happy, fortunate, intelligent, grateful
and mighty. Khadga means a sword.

Kusuma Yoga: If (1) lagna is in a fixed sign, (2) Venus is in a quadrant, (3) Moon is
in a trine with a benefic, and, (4) Saturn is in the 10th house, then this yoga is present.
One born with this yoga becomes a king or an equal. He is charitable. He is endowed
with pleasures and happiness. He is a leader of his community. He has character and
scholarship. Kusuma means a flower.

Kalaanidhi  Yoga:  If  (1)  Jupiter  is  in  the  2nd  house  or  the  5th  house  and  (2)  he  is
conjoined  or  aspected  by  Mercury  and  Venus,  then  this  yoga  is  present.  One  born
with  this  yoga  is  endowed  with  character,  happiness,  good  health,  wealth  and
learning. He is respected by kings. Kalaanidhi means a treasure of arts and skills.

Kalpadruma  Yoga:  Consider  (1)  lagna  lord,  (2)  his  dispositor,  (3)  the  latter’s
dispositor in rasi and (4) in navamsa. If all the four planets are all in quadrants, trines
or exaltation signs, then this yoga is present. An example will make this clearer.

One  born  with  this  yoga  becomes  a  king.  He  likes  wars34.  He  is  very  prosperous,
principled, strong and kind. Kalpadruma is a celestial tree of the heaven. This yoga is
also  known  as  Paarijaata  yoga.  Paarijaata  is  a  celestial  flower.  Some  authors  have
simplified this yoga and wrote that one of the last two planets mentioned can bring
the  yoga  if  in  a  quadrant  or  a  trine  or  exaltation  sign.  Taking  all  the  four  planets
make this a less common yoga, which it ought to be. Let us follow Parasara.

As  an  example,  let  us  look  at  the  rasi  and  navamsa  charts  of  Chatrapati  Shivaji,  a
great king of India (see Chart 9). Lagna lord is Sun. He is in Aq and his dispositor is
Saturn  (lord  of  Aq).  Saturn  is  in  Li  and  his  dispositor  is  Venus.  We  also  need
Saturn’s  dispositor  in  navamsa.  In  navamsa,  Saturn  is  in  Aq  and  his  dispositor  is
Saturn himself.

34 This is not meant negatively. War and curbing bad elements are a king’s duty. The results of this
yoga  include  the  words  “principled”  and  “kind”.  So  the  expression  “likes  wars”  (yuddhapriyah)
should be taken in a positive sense. Shivaji’s example may explain it further.

  128

Thus  we  get  the  four  planets  as  —  Sun,  Saturn,  Venus  and  Saturn.  Sun  is  in  a
quadrant. Saturn is exalted. Venus is in a trine. Thus Shivaji had Kalpadruma yoga.
In navamsa also, Sun is exalted, Saturn is in moolatrikona and Venus is in a lagna.

This makes the  yoga  even more powerful. He was indeed a prosperous,  principled,
strong  and  kind  king  ever  ready  to  take  on  powerful  enemies.  Even  as  he  was
fighting  mighty  Muslim  emperors,  he  was  open-minded  and  treated  all  his  people
equally. He respected every woman as a mother. He stood for every good thing that
Hindu  culture  represented.  About  400  years  after  his  birth,  name  of  this  “dharma
veera” (virtuous warrior) still inspires awe in Indians in general and Maharashtrians
in particular.

Lagnaadhi Yoga: If (1) the 7th and 8th houses from lagna are occupied by benefics
and  (2)  no  malefics  conjoin  or  aspect  these  planets,  then  this  yoga  is  present.  One
born  with  this  yoga  becomes  a  great  person.  He  is  learned  and  happy.  Adhi  means
over or above. We have already seen Adhi Yoga among Chandra yogas. Lagnaadhi
yoga means Adhi Yoga from lagna.

Hari Yoga: If benefics occupy the 2nd, 12th and 8th houses counted from the 2nd lord,
then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is happy, learned and blessed with
wealth and children. Hari is a name of  Lord Vishnu. The 2nd house is the house of
food  and  money  and  it  is  a  trine  from  karma  sthana  –  the  10th  house.  It  stands  for
sustenance and its lord represents Hari – Sustainer of Hindu Trinity – in a chart.

Hara Yoga: If benefics occupy the 4th, 9th and 8th houses counted from the 7th lord,
then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is happy, learned and blessed with
wealth  and  children.  Hara  is  a  name  of  Lord  Shiva.  The  7th  house  rules  death  and
Shiva is represented by its lord. This is why the 7th house shows genitalia and Shiva
is worshipped in the form of a Linga – Phallus – in Hindu temples.

Brahma Yoga: If benefics occupy the 4th, 10th and 11th houses counted from lagna
lord, then this yoga is present. One born with this yoga is happy, learned and blessed
with  wealth  and  children.  Brahma  is  the  creator  of  this  universe.  Lagna  rules  birth
and the Creator is represented in a chart by lagna lord.

NOTE: (1) Some authors combine Hari yoga, Hara yoga and Brahma yoga and call it
“Hari  Hara  Brahma  yoga”.  Also,  these  three  yogas  are  known  as  Trimurthi  Yogas.
Brahma is the Creator; Hari is the Sustainer; and, Shiva is the Destroyer. They form
the Trinity of Gods (Trimurthis).

  130

the  9th lord,  (2)  Venus  is  in  a  quadrant  from  the  11th lord,  and,  (3)  Mercury  is  in  a

present.  One  born  with  this  yoga  is  wealthy,  intelligent,  long-lived  and  victorious
over  enemies.  He  achieves  everything  without  many  obstacles.  Trilochana  means
“one  with three eyes”. It is another name of Lord Siva, who has a hidden eye in His
forehead.

Gouri Yoga: If the lord of the sign occupied in navamsa by the 10th lord is exalted in
the 10th house and lagna lord joins him, then this yoga is present. One born with this
yoga is from a respectable family and he is religious and virtuous. He is blessed with
happiness  from  family.  Gouri  is  a  form  of  Parvati  –  Lord  Siva’s  wife.  She  is  an
epitome of marital bliss and purity.

Chandikaa  Yoga:  If  (1)  lagna  is  in  a  fixed  sign  aspected  by  6th  lord  and  (2)  Sun
joins the lords of the signs occupied in navamsa by 6th and 9th lords, then this yoga is
present. One born with this yoga is aggressive, charitable, wealthy, famous and long-
lived. Chandika is an aggressive form of Parvati. She kills demons mercilessly.

11.7  Raaja Yogas

Raaja  means  a  king.  Raaja  yogas  are  the  combinations  that  give  power  and
prosperity to a native. They make one the best in something.

11.7.1  Basics

Basic  Raaja  Yoga:  In  any  chart,  Lord  Vishnu  sits  in  the  quadrants  and  Goddess
Lakshmi  sits  in  the  trines.  If  the  lord  of  a  quadrant  is  associated  with  the  lord  of  a

  134

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

trine, that association brings the combined blessings of Lakshmi and Vishnu. This is
called a Raaja Yoga. The native is powerful and prosperous.

What do we mean by “association” here? There are 3 important associations:

(1) The two planets are conjoined,
(2) The two planets aspect each other with graha drishti, or,
(3) The two planets have a parivartana (exchange). For example, if the 4th lord is in
the  5th  house  and  the  5th  lord  is  in  the  4th  house,  then  we  say  that  there  is  a
parivartana between the 4th and 5th lords. This is an association.

If  the  lord  of  a  quadrant  and  the  lord  of  a  trine  have  one  of  the  three  kinds  of
associations  mentioned  above,  it  forms  a  Raaja  Yoga.  Lagna  can  be  taken  as  a
quadrant or a trine here. It is both.

Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga: This is a special case of the above yoga. If the lords
of dharma sthana (9th) and karma sthana (10th) form a raja yoga, it is known by this
special name. The 9th house is the most important trine and the 10th house is the most
important quadrant. Raja  yoga involving the lords of these two houses is excellent.
One born with this yoga is sincere, devoted and righteous. He is fortunate and.

Vipareeta  Raaja  Yoga:  The  6th,  8th  and  12th  houses  are  known  as  trik  sthanas  or
dusthanas  (bad  houses).  If  their  lords  occupies  dusthanas  or  conjoin  dusthanas,  it
results in this  yoga. One having this  yoga experiences tremedous success, typically
after an initial struggle. Vipareeta means extreme.

Because dusthanas show the obstacles one faces in life, situation of dusthana lords in
dusthanas shows that obstacles will run into obstacles themselves.  One experiences
tremendous success in the face of obstacles.

In the ideal case, the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses will all be together in one of
the three houses (or the 3rd house or the 11th house), with no other planets conjoining
them. But the results of this yoga may be experienced with just one or two dusthana
lords occupying a dusthana.

11.7.2  Magnitude of a Raaja Yoga

Part 1: Chart Analysis

135

We find the  conjunction of the lords of  a quadrant and  a trine in many  charts. The
magnitude  to  which  this  raaja  yoga  fructifies  depends  on  the  strength  of  the  two
planets. The key factors that come into play are:

(1) The two planets should be free from afflictions from functional malefics.

(2) The conjunction or  aspect responsible  for the Raaja Yoga should be close (say,

within 6° or so).

If  Mercury  and  Venus  are  at  2°  and  26°  in  Ta  for  a  native  with  Cp  lagna,  for
example, their conjunction brings a Raaja Yoga (Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga in
particular). However, the two planets are too far apart for this yoga to give its full
results. They are still associated, but the association is not very strong. If Venus
is  at  3°  in  Ta  in  instead  of  26°,  the  conjunction  is  very  close  and  the  yoga  can
give its full results, if other factors are favorable.

(3) The two planets should not be combust, debilitated or in an inimical house or in

bad avasthas (states).

Any blemishes here will considerably reduce the magnitude of the yoga. In addition
to the above factors, Sage Parasara recommended looking at the amsas occupied by
the 2 planets as per Dasa Varga (ten division) scheme. Count the divisional charts –
out  of  the  ten  charts  of  Dasa  Varga  scheme  –  in  which  a  planet  occupies  an  own,
exaltation or moolatrikona sign. Based on the count of divisional charts with such a
good  placement  for  the  planet  in  question,  we  say  that  it  is  in  a  particular  amsa.
Please see the chapter “Divisional Charts” for details.

If the two planets giving raaja yoga have a count of one or zero, the yoga is ordinary
and gives good results depending on the factors already outlined.

If the two planets are in Paarijaataamsa (count of 2), then one becomes a king who
rules  his  people  well.  If  the  two  planets  are  in  Uttamsaamsa  (count  of  3),  then  one
becomes a good king with tremendous assets. If the two planets are in Gopuraamsa
(count of 4), then one becomes a great king respected by many kings.

If  the  two  planets  are  in  Simhaasanaamsa  (count  of  5),  then  one  becomes  a  great
emperor  who  rules  the  whole  world.  Parasara  said  that  several  great  emperors  of

  136

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Indian  mythology  –  like  Harischandra,  Manu,  Bali,  Vaiswaanara,  Yudhisthira  (also
known as Dharmaraja) and Saalivaahana36 – were born with this combination.

Two planets giving Raaja Yoga can be in Paaraavataamsa (count of 6), Devalokamsa
(count of 7), Brahmalokaamsa (count of 8) and Airaavataamsa (count of 9) only for
divine  persons  such  as  Svaayambhuva  Manu  (Manu  who  was  born  by  Himself),
Brahma (Creator!!) and Vishnu’s incarnations such as Sri Rama and Sri Krishna.

Final  Judgment:  None  of  the  above  factors  influences  the  end  result  completely.
We should look at all the factors and make the final judgment.

Chart 10

India’s former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi37 had lagna lord Sun and 5th lord Jupiter
in  lagna  giving  a  Raaja  Yoga.  Both  were  in  Simhaasanaamsa.  However,  they  were

36  Saalivaahana  was  yet  to  be  born  when  Parasara  wrote  his  classic  “Brihat  Paaraasara  Horaa
Saastram”. He referred Dharmaraja of Mahabharata as “King Yudhisthira of this Yuga” and made a
prediction about the birth of Saalivaahana with Raaja Yoga giving planets in Simhaasanaamsa.

more than 8° apart38 and functional malefics were with them. Saturn had a very close
aspect  on  Jupiter.  So  the  Yoga  is  pretty  weak.  However,  the  two  planets  are  in
Simhasanamsa  and  that  raises  the  level  of  the  Yoga.  In  the  end,  he  only  became
India’s prime minister and not an “emperor of the whole world”.

Let  us  look  at  India’s  emperor  Akbar39  (see  Chart  10).  His  chart  has  Libra  lagna.
Lagna lord Venus and 4th and 5th lord Saturn are in lagna. They  give Mahapurusha
yogas (Maalavya and Sasa) as well as a Raja Yoga. Moon and Mercury own 10th and
9th and they have a close aspect. They also form a Raja Yoga. But they are not even
in Paarijaataamsa. Venus and Saturn are only in Uttamaamsa and Paarijaataamsa.

However, Venus and Saturn are very strong and take part in other Yogas. Both the
Raja Yogas are very close. Venus and Saturn are less than a degree apart. They are
afflicted  by  a  functional  malefic  (Jupiter),  but  Jupiter  is  22°  away  from  them.
Moreover, lord of  GL is Mars and he  gives another Mahapurusha Yoga  – Ruchaka
Yoga – and he is in Simhasanamsa.

Due  to  all  these  reasons,  Akbar  was  a  great  emperor  of  India  although  Raja  Yoga
giving  planets  weren’t  in  Simhaasanaamsa.  We  should  always  make  the  final
judgment after looking at all the factors.

11.7.3  More Raja Yogas

Some advanced Raaja Yogas will be listed below.

(2)

If (a) chara putra karaka (PK) and chara atmaka karaka (AK) are conjoined and
(b)  lagna  and  5th  lords  conjoin,  then  Raaja  Yoga  is  present  and  the  native
enjoys power and prosperity. If only one condition is satisfied, still the results
may be felt, but not fully.

If (a) lagna lord is in 5th, (b) 5th lord is in lagna, (c) AK and PK are in lagna or
the  5th  house,  and  (d)  those  planets  in  owns  rasi  or  amsa  or  in  exaltation  or
aspected by benefics, then this yoga is present and the native becomes a great
king (Maharajah) loved by his associates.

38 Anything greater than 5 or 6 degrees is too large for a Raaja Yoga to give its full results.
39 Birthdata: December 4, 1542, 3:39 am (LMT), 69 E 47, 25 N 19. This date may be written by some
as November 24, 1542 based on the old calendar.

(9)

If the 9th lord and AK are in lagna, 5th or 7th, aspected by benefics, then Raaja
Yoga is present.

If the 2nd, 4th and 5th houses from lagna lord and AK are occupied by benefics,
one becomes a king.

If the 3rd and 6th houses from lagna lord  and AK are occupied or aspected by
malefics, one becomes a king.

If lagna, HL and GL are joined or aspected by the same planet, then that planet
gives a Raaja Yoga. One may add “owned” to “joined or aspected”.

Planets aspecting or joining HL and GL give wealth and power respectively. If
such a planet is associated with lagna also, its potential to do good increases.

Results of this yoga may be experienced if the conditions are not strictly met,
but a planet has an association with lagna (or lagna lord), HL (or HL lord) and
GL (or GL lord). Association here can mean ownership, conjunction or aspect.
If  lagna  lord  is  in  HL  and  aspects  GL  lord,  for  example,  results  of  this Raaja
Yoga may be experienced to some extent.

If  the  same  planet  aspects  lagna  in  the  six  divisional  charts  of  shad  vargas  –
Rasi,  Navamsa,  Hora,  Drekkana,  Dwadasamsa,  Trimsamsa  –  then  that  planet
gives a Raaja Yoga.

If lagna, HL and GL are occupied by  a planet in own or exaltation sign,  then
the native becomes a king. [NOTE: It can be different planets.]

If lagna in Rasi, Navamsa and Drekkana charts is occupied by a planet in own
or  exaltation  sign,  then  the  native  becomes  a  king.  [NOTE:  It  can  be  different
planets.]

(10)  If  (a)  the  3rd,  6th  and  8th  houses  are  occupied  by  one  or  two  planets  in
debilitation and (b) lagna lord is in an own or exaltation sign and aspects lagna,
it forms a Raaja Yoga.

(11)  If  (a) the 6th, 8th and 12th lords are debilitated or combust or in inimical signs
and (b) lagna lord is in an own or exaltation sign and aspects lagna, it forms a
Raaja Yoga.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

139

(12)  If  the  5th  and  9th  lords  are  in  a  conjunction  or  a  mutual  aspect,  it  makes  one

prosperous.

(13)  If (a) the 4th lord is in the 10th house and the 10th lord is in the 4th house and (b)
both of them are aspected by the 5th lord or the 9th lord, then a Raaja Yoga is
formed.

(14)  If (a) the 5th lord is in the 1st, 4th or 10th house and (b) lagna lord or the 9th lord

joins him, then the native becomes a king.

(15)  If  (a)  Moon  is  strong  and  occupies  vargottamamsa40  and  (b)  four  or  more

planets aspect him, then one becomes a king.

(16)  If 4 or more planets occupy moolatrikonas or exaltation signs, one becomes a

king even if he is from a lowly family.

(17)  If benefics are in quadrants and malefics are in the 3rd, 6th and 11th houses, one

becomes a king even if he is from a lowly family.

(18)  If  arudha lagna and darapada (arudha pada of the 7th house) are not in mutual
2nd/12th or 6th/8th positions, then Raja Yogas in the chart will be more effective.

11.8  Raaja Sambandha Yogas

Raaja  means  a  king.  Sambandha  means  relation  or  association.  Raaja  sambandha
yogas  are  the  combinations  that  give  association  with  rulers.  Those  who  have  thse
yogas  are  typically  powerful  ministers,  secretaries,  counsellors  and  bureaucrats,
associated  with  the  rulers  and  powerful  men.  However,  these  yogas  are  very
common. The magnitude of success depends on the strength of the planets involved
in raja yoga.

(1)

If the 10th lord is conjoined or aspected by AmK (chara amaatya kaaraka) or his
dispositor, one becomes an important person in the court of a king.

40 A planet is in vargottamaamsa if it occupies the same sign in Rasi and Navamsa charts.

(3)

(4)

If the 11th lord aspects the 11th house and there are no malefic planets joining or
aspecting  the  10th  and  11th  houses,  one  becomes  an  important  person  in  the
court of a king.

If  AK  (chara  aatma  kaaraka)  and  AmK  conjoin,  one  is  very  intelligent  and
becomes a minister.

If AmK is very strong in own sign or his exaltation sign, then also one becomes
a minister.

(5)

If AmK is in a trine from lagna, one becomes a famous minister.

(6)

If AmK is in a quadrant or a trine from AK, one is an associate liked by a king.

(7)

(8)

(9)

If  malefics  occupy  the  3rd  and  6th  houses  from  lagna,  AL  and  AK,  then  one
becomes a powerful chief of army.

If AK is in an own or exaltation sign in a quadrant or a trine and the 9th lord is
conjoined or aspected by AK, one becomes a minister.

If  AK  happens  to  be  Moon’s  dispositor  and  he  occupies  lagna  along  with  a
benefic, one becomes a minister at an old age.

(10)  If AK is in the 5th,7th, 9th or 10th houses with a benefic, one will be associated

with kings and earn money thus.

(11)  If bhagyapada (A9 – arudha pada of the 9th house) is in lagna or AK is in 9th,

one is fortunate and associates with kings.

(12)  If the 11th lord is in the 11th house without aspects from any malefics and AK is

with benefics, then one has gains from a king.

(13)  If lagna lord is in the 10th house and the 10th lord is in lagna, one is powerful

and associated with kings.

(14)  If Moon and Venus  are  in the 4th house from AK, one is endowed with  royal

insignia.

(15)  If lagna lord or AK conjoins the 5th lord in a quadrant or a trine, one becomes a

king’s friend.

11.9  Dhana Yogas

Dhana means wealth. Dhana yogas are combinations that give one abundant riches.

Basic Principle: The 5th and 9th lords and planets joining them are capable of giving
money. They give dasas in their dasas. The 11th house is also important for material
gains  and  it  should  be  strong.  The  2nd  house  is  also  important.  If  Moon,  Mercury,
Jupiter or Venus is exalted in the 2nd house, it makes the native very rich.

In  addition  to  these  general  principles,  Parasara  listed  specific  combinations  for
various  lagnas.  In  all  these  combinations,  the  strength  of  the  participating  planets
decides the magnitude of results experienced.

(1)  For Ar lagna:  If Sun is in the 5th house and Saturn, Moon and Jupiter are in
the 11th house, one becomes very affluent. If Mars occupies lagna conjoined or
aspected by Mercury, Venus and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich.

(2)  For Ta lagna: If Mercury is in the 5th house and Moon, Mars and Jupiter are in
the 11th house, one becomes very  affluent.  If Venus occupies lagna conjoined
or aspected by Mercury and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich.

(3)  For Ge lagna: If Venus is in the 5th house and Mars is in the 11th house, one
becomes  very  affluent.  If  Mercury  occupies  lagna  conjoined  or  aspected  by
Jupiter and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich.

(4)  For Cn lagna: If Mars is in the 5th house and Venus is in the 11th house, one
becomes  very  affluent.  If  Moon  occupies  lagna  conjoined  or  aspected  by
Mercury and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich.

(5)  For  Le  lagna:  If  Jupiter  is  in the  5th  house  and Mercury  is  in  the  11th  house,
one  becomes  very  affluent.  If  Sun  occupies  lagna  conjoined  or  aspected  by
Mars and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich.

(6)  For Vi lagna:  If Saturn  is in the 5th house  and Sun and Moon are in the  11th
house,  one  becomes  very  affluent.  If  Mercury  occupies  lagna  conjoined  or
aspected by Jupiter and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich.

  142

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(7)  For  Li  lagna:  If  Saturn  is  in  the  5th  house  and  Sun  and  Moon  are  in  the  11th
house,  one  becomes  very  affluent.  If  Venus  occupies  lagna  conjoined  or
aspected by Mercury and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich.

(8)  For  Sc  lagna:  If  Jupiter  is  in  the  5th  house  and  Mercury  is  in  the  11th  house,
one  becomes  very  affluent.  If  Mars  occupies  lagna  conjoined  or  aspected  by
Mercury, Venus and Saturn, then also one becomes very rich.

(9)  For Sg lagna:  If Mars is in the 5th house and Venus is in the 11th house, one
becomes very affluent. If Jupiter occupies lagna conjoined or aspected by Mars
and Mercury, then also one becomes very rich.

(10)  For Cp lagna: If Venus is in the 5th house and Mars is in the 11th house, one
becomes very affluent. If Saturn occupies lagna conjoined or aspected by Mars
and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich.

(11)  For Aq lagna: If Mercury is in the 5th house and Moon, Mars and Jupiter are in
the 11th house, one becomes very affluent. If Saturn occupies lagna conjoined
or aspected by Mars and Jupiter, then also one becomes very rich.

(12)  For Pi lagna: If Moon is in the 5th house and in the 11th house, one becomes
very  affluent.  If  Jupiter  occupies  lagna  conjoined  or  aspected  by  Mars  and
Mercury, then also one becomes very rich.

11.10  Daridra Yogas

One experiences poverty if the following yogas (combinations) are present in one’s
chart:

(1)  Lagna lord is in 12th and 12th lord is in lagna. They are conjoined or aspected by

a maraka planet.

NOTE: The 2nd and 7th houses are maraka (killer houses). Their lords are marakas
(killers). Any malefics occupying 2nd and 7th or associating with 2nd and 7th lords
also become malefics.

(2)  Lagna lord is in 6th and 6th lord is in lagna. They are conjoined or aspected by a

maraka planet.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

143

(3)  Lagna or Moon is with Ketu. Lagna lord is in 8th. A maraka planet conjoins or

aspects lagna lord.

(4)  Lagna  lord  is  with  a  malefic  in  a  dusthana  (6th,  8th  or  12th)  and  2nd  lord  is
debilitated  or  in  an  enemy’s  sign.  Even  a  royal  scion  with  this  combination
becomes poor.

(5)  The 5th lord is in 6th and 9th lord is in 12th, with aspects from marakas.

(6)  Malefics  occupy  lagna  without  9th  and  10th  lords,  aspected  or  conjoined  by

marakas.

(7)  Lords  of  the  signs  occupied  by  6th,  8th  and  12th  lords  are  in  6th,  8th  and  12th

houses, conjoined or aspected by malefics.

(8)  Lord of the sign occupied by Moon in navamsa is with a maraka or occupies a

maraka house (2nd and 7th).

(9)  Lords of lagna in rasi and navamsa are conjoined or aspected by marakas.

(10) Benefics are in malefic houses and malefics are in benefic houses.

(11) Planets conjoined by 6th, 8th and 12th lords give loss of wealth in their dasas, if

they are not conjoined or aspected by the lords of trines.

(12) Mars  and  Saturn  are  in  2nd  and  Mercury  doesn’t  aspect  them.  (Exception:  If

Mercury aspects Mars and Saturn in 2nd, great wealth is generated.)

(13) Sun in 2nd is aspected by Saturn. (Exception: If Saturn doesn’t aspect, Sun in 2nd

gives wealth.)

The general principles emerging from the above combinations are:

Dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th) and their lords are detrimental to wealth. If lagna, lagna
lord and trine lords are afflicted by them, one may be poor. Conjunction or aspect of
marakas clinches the issue. However, conjunction or aspect of trine lords is a saving
factor. In addition, the planets in the 2nd house and the strength of 2nd lord matter.

11.11  Conclusion

A  lot  of  combinations  and  results  have  been  given  in  this  chapter.  Readers  are
advised to read more literature and practice yogas on real charts. One should be able
to find with a quick glance the  yogas present in a chart. Experience certainly helps
there. In the rest of this book, we will see some examples of yogas.

When  looking  at  the  results  ascribed  to  various  yogas,  try  to  fit  them  in  today’s
world.  For  example,  one  with  Kamala  yoga  may  not  really  become  a  king,  but
probably  become  the  Prime  Minister  of  a  nation  or  the  Governor  of  a  state.  When
using  yogas  in  divisional  charts,  adapt  the  results  to  the  matters  signified  by  the
chart.

All  the  great  results  ascribed  to  some  yogas  may  not  materialize  in  reality,  due  to
weaknesses  in  them.  Unless  a  yoga  is  very  strong,  all  the  results  cannot  expected.
Just one yoga cannot make or break a personality, unless it is very powerful.

In  the  case  of  yogas  with  many  conditions,  partial  results  may  sometimes  be
experienced if all the conditions are not satisfied.

12.  Ashtakavarga

12.1  Introduction

Analyzing  a  chart  and  making  correct  predictions  requires  mixing  many  different
principles and making fine compromises and judgments. Sage Parasara said that it is
difficult for even great Maharshis. In Kali Yuga41, human beings become sinful and
the  sins  kill  their  intelligence.  Parasara  said  that  the  intellectual  pygmies  of  Kali
Yuga cannot cope with too many complicated principles and presented ashtakavarga
as a simple technique that lets them make reasonable predictions without much fuss.
Ashtaka means “consisting of eight” and varga means “a group”. Ashtakavarga is the
system of analyzing a chart with respect to a group of 8 reference points.

When we analyze the positions of planets with respect to lagna, we have the concept
of good and bad placements. For example, Jupiter in the 9th from lagna will be well
placed and Jupiter in the 3rd will be badly placed. Mars in the 3rd from lagna will be
well placed and Mars in the 9th will be badly placed.

However, lagna is not the only reference point in a chart. We have Sun and Moon. In
fact, all the planets serve as reference points in a chart and they represent the sources
of  various  energies  that  are  present  in  a  native.  Based  on  the  houses  in  which
different  planets  are  placed  in  transit,  they  can  be  benefic  with  respect  to  some
energy sources and malefic with respect to some. If a transiting planet is benefic with
respect to more energy sources, then it brings good results.

So ashtakavarga is essentially a system that tells us the benefic positions of lagna and
seven planets with respect to each other. This can be used to analyze the strength of a
natal chart, but it is much more important in analyzing transits.

41  As  per  Vedic  science,  time  is  divided  into  a  cycle  of  four  Yugas  that  keep  repeating.  Those  are:
Krita yuga (1,728,000 years), Treta yuga (1,296,000 years), Dwapara yuga (864,000 years) and Kali
yuga (432,000 years). In Krita yuga, religiousness and virtuosity of human beings is exemplary. It is
the worst in Kali yuga. It gradually worsens from Krita yuga to Kali yuga. We are currently in Kali
yuga. It started about 5,000 years back.

In Table 19, an entry of 0 denotes a malefic position or a “karana” or a bindu (dot).
An  entry  of  1  denotes  a  benefic  position  or  a  “sthana”  or  a  rekha  (line)42.  To
understand how to read this table, let us go to the column titled “Merc” in Table 19.
This shows benefic houses for Sun to occupy, with respect to Mercury. The 1st and
2nd  houses  have  0  and  the  3rd  house  has  1.  So  the  first  2  houses  from  Mercury  are
malefic  for  Sun  and  the  3rd  house  is  benefic  for  Sun.  Table  20-Table  26  give  the
benefic  and  malefic  houses  of  Moon,  Mars,  Mercury,  Jupiter,  Venus,  Saturn  and
lagna (respectively).

42 Some astrologers (especially south Indian astrologers) use a different notation. They use “bindu” to
describe a benefic house (1) and “rekha” to describe malefic house (0). Let us follow Parasara.

Readers without a computer program should memorize these tables. To the modern
reader  who  is  overly  dependent  on  computers,  memorizing  these  tables  may  seem
like  a  daunting  task.  As  our  dependency  on  technology  increases,  several  skills  of
our  brain  are  left  either  unused  or  undeveloped  and  those  skills  slowly  vanish.
Computing  ashtakavarga  by  hand  is  not  as  difficult  as  it  may  seem  to  be.  In  fact,
even  today,  some  people  in  India  compute  all  the  ashtakavarga  tables  by  hand  in  a
matter of a few minutes.

Example  37:  Let  us  say  Venus  is  in  Ge.  Find  the  rasis  in  which  Jupiter  is  benefic
with respect to Venus.

To find the rasis in which Jupiter is benefic, we should look at Jupiter’s ashtakavarga
(see Table 23). To find the rasis in which Jupiter is benefic with respect to Venus, we
should  look  at  the  column  of  Venus.  Only  the  2nd,  5th,  6th,  9th,  10th  and  11th  houses
have  a  1  (rekha  –  benefic  point)  against  them.  Venus  is  in  Ge  and  finding  these
houses with respect to Venus, we get Cn, Li, Sc, Aq, Pi and Ar. So Jupiter is benefic
with respect to Venus in these rasis.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

151

Exercise 18: Consider the rasi chart in Chart 6. Find the rasis in which Mercury is
benefic with respect to different planets and lagna.

12.3  Bhinna Ashtakavarga

In  this  book,  we  will  denote  ashtakavarga  with  AV.  We  prepare  what  is  known  as
“Bhinna  Ashtakavarga”  for  each  planet.  It  is  denoted  with  BAV.  Bhinna  means
“separate”. When preparing the BAV of a planet, we count the number of references
from which the planet is benefic in each rasi and put that count in that rasi. For each
planet,  we  prepare  a  different  BAV.  Sometimes  we  may  simply  use  the  word
“ashtakavarga” (AV) to represent a BAV.

The count in each rasi is between 0 to 8. It is called the number of rekhas (benefic
points) in that rasi. If a planet is in a sign with a count of 5, 6, 7 or 8, it means that
the  planet  is  benefic  in  that  rasi  with  respect  to  more  references.  So  the  planet  is
favorable. If a planet is in a sign with a count of 3, 2, 1 or 0, it means that the planet
is malefic in that rasi with respect to more references. So the planet is unfavorable. If
the count is 4, the planet is neutral. We can use this analysis in natal charts and also
transit charts.

Example  38:  Let  us  go  further  with  Exercise  18  now.  After  finding  the  rasis  in
which  Mercury  is  benefic  with  respect  to  various  references,  let  us  count  the
references with respect to which Mercury is benefic in each rasi. From the answer to
Exercise 18, we see that Mercury is benefic in Ar with respect to Sun, Moon, Mars,
Mercury,  Venus,  Saturn  and  lagna.  In  other  words,  Mercury  is  benefic  in  Ar  with
respect to  7 references.  So we write 7 in Ar. We see that Mercury is benefic in Ta
with respect to Sun, Mercury, Venus and Saturn. In other words, Mercury is benefic
in  Ta  with  respect  to  4  references.  So  we  write  4  in  Ta.  We  find  the  count  of
references for each rasi and prepare a chart. This is called Mercury’s BAV or simply
Mercury’s AV. Readers may complete the calculations and verify with Chart 11.

In Ar and Ge, we have 7 rekhas. So Mercury is benefic in those rasis with respect to
7 references out of 8. In Aq, we have 6 rekhas. So these three rasis are particularly
favorable  for  Mercury.  In  Vi  and  Cp,  we  have  3  rekhas  and  that  is  the  lowest.  So
Mercury  is  particularly  unfavorable  in  Vi  and  Cp.  We  can  use  this  information  to

  152

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

interpret  how  favorable  Mercury  is  in  the  natal  chart  or  in  a  transit  chart.  Here
Mercury  is  in  Ge  in  the  natal  chart  and  Ge  has  7  rekhas  in  Mercury’s  AV.  That
means that Mercury is a very  favorable planet.  Being the lagna lord and being in a
quadrant  from  lagna  in  own  sign  (i.e.  Bhadra  yoga)  makes  him  even  stronger.
Because  of  this,  Mercury  is  extremely  favorable  in  this  chart.  No  wonder  Sri  P.V.
Narasimha  Rao  is  a  brilliant  scholar,  well  versed  in  many  languages.  He  is  an
excellent  writer  and  he  won  a  prestigious  literary  award  for  a  literary  work  in  a
language that is not his mother tongue.

Chart 11

Exercise 19: Find the number of rekhas in all the rasis in the BAVs of Sun, Moon,
Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn for the same rasi chart (see Chart 6).

12.4  Samudaaya Ashtakavarga

Samudaaya means “group”. Samudaaya Ashtakavarga is nothing but the sum of the
ashtakavargas  of  seven  planets.  In  each  rasi,  we  add  the  number  of  rekhas  in  the

Part 1: Chart Analysis

153

BAVs  of  Sun,  Moon,  Mars,  Mercury,  Jupiter,  Venus  and  Saturn.  The  sum  denotes
the number of rekhas in that rasi in Samudaaya Ashtakavarga. It will be denoted with
SAV. It is also called “Sarva Ashtakavarga” (sarva = all).

Let us continue  with the rasi chart in Chart 6.  From the answer to Exercise 19, we
see that the BAVs of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn have 5,
3, 4, 7, 4, 8 and 3 rekhas in Ar (respectively). Adding them all, we get 34. So SAV
has 34 rekhas in Ar and we write 34 in Ar. We can find the number of rekhas in all
the rasis in the same manner and prepare a chart with the number of rekhas written in
each rasi.

Exercise  20:  Find  the  number  of  rekhas  in  all  the  rasis  in  SAV  for  the  same  rasi
chart (see Chart 6).

A rasi with 30 or more rekhas becomes strong. Matters signified by the house falling
in such a rasi flourish and planets transiting in such a rasi bring good results. A rasi
with 25-30 rekhas is average. A rasi with less than 25 rekhas becomes weak. Matters
signified by the house falling in such a rasi suffer and planets transiting in such a rasi
bring bad results.

When  choosing  muhurtas43
like  a  wedding  or
housewarming, one should look at the strengths, as per SAV of the natal chart, of the
rasis  containing  lagna,  Moon  and  Sun  in  the  muhurta  chart.  Rasis  containing  30  or
more rekhas in SAV are favorable.

for  auspicious  activities

12.5  Divisional Charts

There is a misconception that ashtakavarga is applicable only to rasi charts. Parasara
does not say it. Parasara lists the divisional charts in which different areas of life are
seen,  at  the  very  beginning  of  BPHS.  So  all  the  analysis  in  the  rest  of  his  classic
applies to all the divisional charts, unless Parasara explicitly mentions rasi chart. For
example, Parasara says that D-12 shows matters related to father. So any principles
based on ashtakavarga and sodhya pindas that let us predict matters related to father

43 Muhurta is an auspicious pre-set time at which one begins important activities.

  154

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

must use D-12. This is a logical deduction and Parasara does not have to mention it
explicitly each time.

If we can judge the benefic positions of various planets with respect to 8 references
in rasi chart, there is no reason why we should not do it in all the divisional charts. In
fact, this becomes invaluable when we interpret transits in rasi chart with respect to
the natal positions in divisional charts and transits in divisional charts with respect to
the natal positions in rasi chart.

Ashtakavarga  of  divisional  charts  is  prepared  in  the  same  manner  as  that  of  rasi
chart.  The  benefic  houses  for  each  planet  with  respect  to  the  8  references  are  the
same. We can apply the same rules and find the BAVs of all planets. In fact, we can
find SAV of a divisional chart too.

Example 39:  Let us  consider the rasi chart and  D-10 of  India’s Prime  Minister Sri
A.B. Vajpayee (see Chart 3 for birthdata).

Readers may find SAV of rasi and D-10 and verify the following:

SAV of Rasi chart:

         Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

Rekhas   29 22 27 29 28 38 29 26 23 34 28 24

SAV of D-10 chart:

         Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

Rekhas   23 26 33 20 28 33 26 35 28 31 24 30

In  rasi  chart,  the  11th  house  has  the  maximum  number  of  rekhas  (38)  showing
excellent gains. The 3rd house of communication has 34 rekhas. With the significator
of communication Mercury and the artistic Moon in the 3rd house, he is an excellent
communicator, great orator and poet. Though Sri Vajpayee’s career wasn’t a bed of
roses  –  he  struggled  in  the  opposition  parties  for  most  of  his  career  –  he  finally
became  India’s  Prime  Minister  and  one  must  agree  that  he  had  a  very  successful
career. He is known as a man of great character. With lagna and the 10th house in the
SAV of rasi chart containing only 26  and 28  rekhas – which is just average –  why
did he have such a successful career?

Part 1: Chart Analysis

155

The answer lies in the SAV of D-10. Lagna in D-10 is Sc and it contains 35 rekhas –
maximum in  D-10’s  SAV.  Arudha  lagna  also  contains  more  than  30  rekhas.  These
factors explain his success and good name. The 3rd house in D-10 also has more than
30 rekhas – like in the rasi chart – and that increases the chance of being an excellent
communicator in public life. Though D-10 is powerful with lagna and arudha lagna
containing more than 30 rekhas, one may notice that the 8th house in D-10 (Ge) has
33 rekhas in D-10’s SAV. This explains the struggle in Vajpayee’s career.

Chart 12

Exercise  21:  Consider  the  D-10  chart  of  a  lady,  shown  in  Chart  12.  Compute  the
SAV  of  this  D-10.  Suppose  we  are  told  that  she  has  an  unsuccessful  career  as  a
waiter in a small restaurant. Based on D-10’s SAV, does it make sense? If not, guess
her career. [HINT: Look at the number of rekhas in lagna and the 10th house.]

  156

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

12.6  Prastaara Ashtakavarga

Using  the  Bhinna  Ashtakavarga  (BAV)  of  a  planet,  we  can  find  out  the  rasis  in
which it is benefic with respect to more references and the rasis in which it is malefic
with respect to more references. To interpret transits, this is sometimes not enough.
For example, if we know that a planet is benefic in Ta with respect to 5 references,
that may not be enough. We may need to know exactly what those 5 references are.
If we are looking for Jupiter’s transit that brings marriage, for example, we may want
Jupiter to be benefic in his transit rasi with respect to certain planets (Venus or DK
or  7th  lord  in  navamsa,  for  example).  In  such  situations,  we  need  to  know  exactly
which references a planet is benefic from.

For this purpose, we prepare “Prastaara Astakavarga”. It will be denoted with PAV.
Prastaara means “spread-out”. PAV is a spreadsheet that shows the exact references
from  which  a  planet  is  benefic  in  a  rasi.  We  prepare  one  PAV  for  each  planet.
Different people may represent PAV differently. Some people may cast a chart and
write  the  list  of  benefic  references  in  each  rasi.  For  some  people,  the  answer  to
Exercise  18  may  qualify  as  Mercury’s  PAV.  Some  people  may  prefer  to  represent
the same information as shown in Table 27.

The basic purpose of a planet’s PAV is to show the references with respect to which
the planet is benefic in each rasi.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

157

NOTE: From PAV, we can construct BAV easily. From Table 27, we may note that
the  sum  of  all  the  entries  in  each  column  –  rasi  –  in  a  PAV  gives  the  number  of
rekhas in that rasi in BAV. This is shown in the last row.

12.7  Sodhya Pindas

We discussed the computation of BAV before. By applying some reductions on the
values  in  BAV,  we  get  “Sodhita  Ashtakavarga”  (SoAV).  Using  it,  we  find  Sodhya
Pindas of different planets. These pindas are very important in predicting key events
and we will talk about them again in the part “Transit Analysis”.

12.7.1  Trikona Sodhana (Trinal Reduction)

Consider the BAV of a planet. Look at different sets of mutual trines separately (e.g.
First set: Ar, Le and Sg, Second set: Ta, Vi and Cp) and apply the following rules on
each set:

(1) If atleast one rasi has zero, no reduction is necessary.44
(2) If the three rasis have the same value, make them all zero.
(3) Take the lowest value out of the three. Subtract it from all the values.

Example 40: As an example, let us take Mercury’s BAV given in Chart 11. Let us
takes fiery trines. Ar, Le and Sg have 7, 4 and 4 rekhas. Rules (1) and (2) don’t apply
and we go to (3). The lowest value is 4. Subtracting it from the three values, we write
3, 0 and 0 in Ar, Le and Sg respectively. Let us take the watery trines now. Cn, Sc
and Pi have 4 rekhas each. Rule (2) applies and we write zero in all the three rasis.
Readers may carry out the reduction for the remaining two sets of trines and verify
that we get the following table after Trikona Sodhana:

         Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

Mercury   3  1  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  2  0

44 Some authors suggest that this applies only if there is zero in exactly one rasi. If two rasis have a
zero, they suggest making the third one also zero. But this is inconsistent with the spirit of the other
rules. The idea is to subtract the lowest value from others. In that sense, (1) and (2) are special cases
cases of (3). The change suggested by these authors is inconsistent with this. Let us follow Parasara.

  158

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

12.7.2  Ekaadhipatya Sodhana (Co-owned Reduction)

After we carry out Trikona Sodhana, we carry out another reduction on the pairs of
signs that are owned by the same planet. Ar and Sc are owned by Mars; Ta and Li
are  owned  by  Venus;  Ge  and  Vi  are  owned  by  Mercury;  Sg  and  Pi  are  owned  by
Jupiter; and, Cp and Aq are owned by Saturn. We apply a reduction on these pairs of
rasis separately, using the following rules:

(1) If atleast one of the rasis has a zero in it, no reduction is necessary and stop here.

(2) If  both  the  rasis  are  occupied  by  a  planet  (or  planets),  again  no  reduction  is

necessary and stop here.

(3) If one rasi is occupied by a planet (or planets) and the other is empty, then do the

following:

(a) If the empty rasi has a lower value, replace the value with a zero.
(b) If the empty rasi has a higher value, replace the value with the value in the

other rasi.

(4) If both the rasis are empty, then do the following:

(a) If both the rasis have the same value, replace both with zero.
(b) If they have different values, replace the higher value with the lower value.

Example 41: Let us continue with Example 40. Let us take Ar and Sc. Sc has zero in
it and (1) applies. So there is no reduction. In fact, (1) applies to all pairs and so all
the values remain unchanged after Ekaadhipatya reduction.

Example 42: Let us consider some other hypothetical examples to understand all the
rules correctly.
(a) Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta is
occupied by Mars and Li by Jupiter and Saturn. In this case, rule (2) applies and
we do not alter the values.

(b) Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta is
occupied  by  Mars  and  Li  is  empty.  In  this  case,  rule  (3a)  applies  and  we  write
zero in Li, as Li is empty and it has a lower value than Ta.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

159

(c)  Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta is
empty and Li is occupied by Jupiter and Saturn. In this case, rule (3b) applies and
we write 2 in Ta, as Ta is empty and it has a higher value than Li.

(d) Let us say Ta and Li have 4 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta
and Li are empty. In this case, rule (4b) applies and we replace the higher value 4
with the lower value 2. So we write 2 in Ta.

(e)  Let us say Ta and Li have 2 and 2 rekhas after Trikona reduction. Let us say Ta
and Li are empty. In this case, rule (4a) applies and we write zero in Ta and Li.

12.7.3  Sodhya Pindas

After carrying out Trikona sodhana and then Ekaadhipatya sodhana on the BAV of a
planet,  we  get  the  “Sodhita  Ashtakavarga”  of  that  planet.  We  denote  Sodhita
Ashtakavarga  with  SoAV.45  From  it,  we  find  “Sodhya  Pinda”  of  each  planet.  This
will be used in transit analysis.

For each rasi, we multiply the number in that rasi in SoAV with the multiplier of that
rasi  (shown  in  Table  28).  We  find  such  a  product  for  all  the  12  rasis.  We  find  the
sum of the products of all the 12 rasis and the sum is called rasi pinda.

For  each  planet,  we  multiply  the  number  in  the  rasi  containing  that  planet  with  the
multiplier  of  that  planet  (shown  in  Table  29).  We  find  such  a  product  for  all  the  7
planets.  We  find  the  sum  of  the  products  of  all  the  7  planets  and  the  sum  is  called
graha pinda.

45 This chart has several purposes  which  will not be covered in this book. An example is Vaastu or
Sthaapatya Veda or the Vedic Science of Architecture. The direction signified by the rasis containing
most  rekhas  in  the  SoAV  of  a  planet  should  contain  the  room  in  which  the  activity  related  to  the
planet  takes  place.  For  example,  we  should  look  at  the  SoAV  of  Venus  to  decide  where  bedroom
should  be.  We  should  look  Jupiter’s  SoAV  to  decide  where  money  and  jewels  should  be  kept.  We
should  look  at  Moon’s  SoAV  to  decide  the  living  room  (hall).  Mercury  is  important  for  the  study
room. Sun is important for the pooja room.

By  adding  rasi  pinda  and  graha  pinda,  we  get  “Sodhya  Pinda”  of  the  planet  whose
SoAV we are working with.

Example  43:  Let  us  continue  with  Mercury’s  SoAV  found  in  Example  40  and
Example 41.

       Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

SoAV:   3  1  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  2  0

Rasi Pinda: Product for Ar is 3 x 7 = 21. Product for Ta is 1 x 10 = 10. Product for
Ge  is  3  x  8  =  24.  Product  for  Aq  is  2  x  11  =  22.  Product  for  other  rasis  is  zero,
because they contain zero and we get zero by multiplying zero with any number. The
sum of all the products is 21 + 10 + 24 + 22 = 77. So rasi pinda is 77.

Graha  Pinda:  Sun,  Mars  and  Mercury  are  in  Ge,  which  has  3  rekhas  in  SoAV.
Product of Sun is 3 x 5 = 15. Product of Mars is 3 x 8 = 24. Product of Mercury is 3 x
5 = 15. Venus is in Ar, which has 3. Product of Venus is 3 x 7 = 21. Other planets are
in  rasis  with  zero  in  them.  So  the  product  is  zero  for  them.  The  sum  of  all  the
products is 15 + 24 + 15 + 21 = 75. So graha pinda is 75.

We get sodhya pinda of Mercury by adding rasi pinda and graha pinda. We get 77 +
75 = 152. So Mercury’s sodhya pinda in this chart is 152.

12.8  Controversies

With some authors using the term bindu (dot) to denote a benefic house and the term
rekha (line) to denote a malefic house – which is the opposite of what we learnt in
this  chapter  –  readers  may  be  confused  when  reading  other  books.  So  they  should
keep  in  mind  that  there  are  different  conventions  in  vogue.  We  are  following
Parasara’s conventions in this book.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

161

The  above  is  merely  a  problem  of  different  naming  conventions.  It  is  not  a  serious
issue at all. It is just a matter of getting used to different nomenclature. But there is
another issue, which is far more serious. There are a few inconsistencies between the
lists  of  benefic  houses  of  Moon  and  Venus  as  given  by  Maharshi  Parasara  and  the
great  astrologer Varahamihira, who is relatively modern,  as he belongs to 600 AD.
These inconsistencies may have arisen due to corruption of texts in time46.

To define a planet’s ashtakavarga, Parasara first  gives the  count of references from
which the planet is malefic in the 1st house and then he lists the references. He does
the same thing for all houses. So we can crosscheck. As if this isn’t enough, the Sage
then lists the references from which the planet is benefic. He does it in all the houses
again.  Just  as  “checksum”  values  are  transmitted  in  today’s  digital  communication
schemes  to  provide  resilience  to  transmission  errors,  the  Sage,  who  normally  uses
words  sparingly,  takes  plenty  of  care  to  ensure  that  his  teachings  on  ashtakavarga
remain  difficult  to  corrupt.  To  corrupt  one  house  value  in  Parasara’s  account  of
ashtakavarga, one has to consciously re-write the verses in three different places in a
consistent  fashion.  With  the  direct  approach  adopted  by  other  authors,  one  can
change  the  table  just  by  changing  one  word.  For  example,  changing  “sukha”
(comfort  –  4th)  to  “suta”  (son  –  5th)  changes  one  value  without  affecting  the  meter
used in the verses. With Parasara’s indirect approach, consistent changes in multiple
places  are  required  for  a  single  value  change.  So  Parasara’s  indirect  approach  is
superior in corruption resistance. We will follow Parasara in this book.

Just for the information of the reader, the places of conflict will be mentioned below:

(1) Moon’s ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Moon is benefic in the 9th from Moon and
malefic  in  the  9th  from  Mars.  As  per  Varahamihira,  Moon  is  malefic  in  the  9th
from Moon and benefic in the 9th from Mars.

(2) Moon’s  ashtakavarga:  As  per  Parasara,  Moon  is  benefic  in  the  2nd  from  Jupiter
and malefic in the 12th from Jupiter. As per Varahamihira, Moon is malefic in the
2nd from Jupiter and benefic in the 12th from Jupiter.

46 In India, books seldom existed on paper and classics were transmitted from one generation to the
other, mostly by word of mouth. People got the classics by heart and recited them to their children and
students. Books were written in poetry, using nice meters, to facilitate memorization.

  162

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(3) Venus’s ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Venus is benefic in the 4th from Mars and
malefic  in  the  5th  from  Mars.  As  per  Varahamihira,  Venus  is  malefic  in  the  4th
from Mars and benefic in the 5th from Mars.

The definitions and calculations given in this chapter strictly follow Parasara for the
reasons  already mentioned. However, readers are welcome to  experiment and draw
their own conclusions. Until authentic and conclusive researches are conducted into
the use of sodhya pindas in the timing of events, we cannot conclusively resolve the
above controversy.

Apart from this, there is another needless controversy related to ashtakavarga. Some
people  prepare  “bhava  chakra”  or  “chalit  chakra”  using  Sripathi’s  (or  Porphyry’s)
house devision method and use that chart to cast ashtakavarga. If Saturn is at 3º in Vi
and lagna is at 27º in Le, they are very close and these people argue that Saturn is in
the 1st house from lagna and not in the 2nd house. These people make a bhava chakra
accordingly and use it in ashtakavarga. However, if lagna is at 15º in Le, Saturn is at
3º in Vi and Jupiter is at 27º in Le, they may take Saturn to be in the 2nd house from
Jupiter.  They  compute  a  bhava  chakra  with  multi-sign  houses  only  with  respect  to
lagna  and  not  with  respect  to  all  the  references  used  in  ashtakavarga.  So  their
approach is neither here nor there.

The  stand  of  this  book  is  very  clear  –  each  bhava  (house)  with  respect  to  one
reference can only be in one rasi. Even if Saturn is at 1º in Vi and lagna is at 29º in
Le, we still say that the 1st house is in Le, the 2nd house is in Li and Saturn is in the
2nd  house  (though  he  is  only  2º  away  from  lagna).  We  do  not  recognize  the  house
division methods of Porphyry and others in this book. Each rasi is a house and the 1st
house is the rasi containing the reference. Readers will do well to  follow Maharshi
Parasara and ignore the creations and borrowings of later day Indian astrologers.

possibly cannot belong to an unsuccessful waiter at a small restaurant. This has to be
someone pretty successful.

Now let us guess her career.

Apart from the 1st and 10th houses, the 2nd house is strong in D-10’s SAV, with 33
rekhas. This shows the importance of speech and voice in her career. Ghati lagna is
in Taurus and its lord Venus occupies it. This makes ghati lagna and 9th house very
powerful. This shows a fortunate (9th) and famous (GL) entertainer (Venus). Saturn’s
11th house argala on GL suggests popular mass support as a catalyst in her success.
Rahu’s  unobstructed  2nd  house  argala  on  lagna  shows  unconventional  behavior  in
public life.47

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

13.  Interpreting Charts

13.1  Introduction

In  the  previous  chapters,  we  have  learnt  various  parameters  and  tools  available  in
Vedic astrology. When it comes to putting them all together and interpreting charts,
there is no substitute for experience. One should also refer to classics and “How to
Judge a Horoscope” (Vols I & II) by Dr. B.V. Raman, to become familiar with the
standard results attributed to different planets being in different houses and the lords
of  different  houses  being  in  various  houses.  In  this  chapter,  we  will  cover  some
topics  not  covered  yet  and  go  through  a  couple  of  examples  of  interpreting  charts.
We will see many more examples in the rest of this book.

13.2  Functional Nature

We learnt that Jupiter, Venus, waxing Moon and well-associated Mercury are natural
benefics.  We  learnt  that  Sun,  Mars,  Saturn,  Rahu,  Ketu,  waning  Moon  and  ill-
associated  Mercury  are  natural  malefics.  In  addition,  we  have  the  concept  of
functional benefics and functional malefics.

The lords of trines from lagna are functional benefics. The lords of 3rd, 6th and 11th
are  functional  malefics.  The  lord  of  a  quadrant  is  a  functional  malefic  if  he  is  a
natural benefic and functionally neutral if he is a natural malefic. The lords of 2nd, 8th
and  12th  are  functionally  neutral.  Of  these,  the  8th  house  is  more  malefic  than  the
other two.

Planet owning a quadrant and a trine becomes a yogakaraka (excellent planet).

In  the  case  of  planets  owning  two  rasis,  we  need  to  judiciously  combine  the  two
indications.  The  list  of  yogakarakas,  functional  benefics,  functional  neutrals  and
functional  malefics  for  each  lagna  is  given  in  Table  30.  Moon  is  not  listed  for
movable  rasis,  because  his  functional  nature  depends  on  whether  he  is  waxing  or
waning. Waxing Moon is a natural benefic and he becomes a functional malefic with

Part 1: Chart Analysis

167

quadrant  ownership.  Waning  Moon,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  natural  malefic  and
quadrant ownership makes him functionally neutral.

A  functional  benefic  is  a  favorable  planet  in  a  chart.  Placement  of  a  functional
benefic  in  quadrants  (sustenance)  and  trines  (prosperity)  brings  good  results.
Placement  of  a  functional  malefic  in  these  houses  is  not  good,  unless  it  is  very
strong. A functional malefic placed in the 3rd house and dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th
houses) brings good results, by spoiling the significations of the bad houses.

If a planet aspects or conjoins or owns HL and lagna, it becomes a yogada (giver of
yoga)  in  money  matters.  If  a  planet  aspects  or  conjoins  or  owns  GL  and  lagna,  it

  168

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

becomes  a  yogada  in  the  matters  of  power  and  authority.  Irrespective  of  their
functional  nature,  planets  that  become  yogada  bring  goodluck.  Similarly,  planets
involved in important yogas also bring good luck.

We should consider the inherent nature and the functional nature of planets. Whether
a planet is a natural benefic or a natural malefic is analogous to whether a person is
inherently  good  or  bad.  Whether  a  planet  is  a  functional  benefic  or  a  functional
malefic  is  analogous  to  whether  a  person  does  good  or  bad  to  one.  Just  as  a  nice
person may harm one  and a bad person may do  good, natural benefics can become
functional malefics and natural malefics can become functional benefics.

13.3  Baadhakas

For a house falling in a movable/fixed/dual rasi, the 11th/9th/7th house (respectively)
from  there  becomes  baadhaka  sthaana  (troubling  spot).  Its  lord  is  called  a
“baadhaka” (troublemaker) for the original house. The list of baadhaka sthaanas and
baadhakas corresponding to each rasi is given in Table 31.

For  example,  suppose  lagna  in  someone’s  D-10  is  in  Ge.  Then  Jupiter  is  baadhaka
for lagna. The periods of Jupiter and planets in Sg can create some obstructions and
troubles in career. Let us take another house. Aq is the 9th house and the 9th house in
D-10 shows the guidance one  gets in one’s career.  It can show manager and elders
giving  guidance.  Baadhaka  sthana  for  Aq  is  Li.  So  the  periods  of  Venus  and
occupants of Li can create some troubles related to the guidance one gets. There may
be  some  troubles  related  to  manager.  Thus  we  can  consider  baadhaka  from  every
house and arudha pada in every divisional chart.

13.4  Analyzing Charts

13.4.1  Basic Guidelines

When we analyze the charts, we should remember all the concepts we learnt in the
previous chapters. The following factors must be remembered:

(1) Divisional  Chart:  Use  the  correct  divisional  chart  for  the  matter  of  interest.
Suppose  we  are  looking  at  happiness  from  a  vehicle.  D-16  is  the  best  chart.
Suppose we are trying to analyze a criminal’s psychology. D-30 is the best chart.
Suppose  we  are  analyzing  marriage.  D-9  is  the  best  chart.  Suppose  we  are
analyzing  marriage  in  a  culture  where  marriage  is  not  a  dharma  (duty)  and  a
union of souls, but it is merely living together of two people, then rasi chart may
be better than D-9. Suppose we want to study one’s religious activities. Then D-
20 is the chart. If we want to study one’s learning, D-24 is the chart. Suppose we
want to study one’s career and achievements in society, D-10 chart is the correct
chart. In this manner, we should choose the correct divisional chart.

(2) House: We should choose the correct house after choosing the correct divisional
chart. Let us say that we are analyzing someone’s learning related activities and
decided to look at D-24. If we want to see his education, we see the 4th house. If
we  want  to  see  his  intelligence,  scholarship,  academic  reputation,  academic
distinctions/awards, students etc, we should look at the 5th house. If we want to
see how one, in one’s pursuit of knowledge, interacts with others and what kind
of  people  one  interacts  with,  then  we  should  see  the  7th  house.  Like  that,  we
choose the correct house for the matter of interest.

(3) Reference:  We  should  choose  the  correct  reference  for  counting  houses.  In  the
above example of D-24, academic reputation is related more to the perceived self
(AL) than the true self (lagna). So it is seen from the 5th from arudha lagna (AL).
Intelligence  and  scholarship,  on  the  other  hand,  are  related  to  the  true  self  and

  170

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

they are seen from the 5th from lagna. When the relevant karakas are stronger, we
can use them as references instead of lagna. So scholarship can be seen from the
5th from Mercury. Students can be seen from the 5th lord. Intelligence can be seen
from the 5th from Jupiter. Academic reputation can be seen in D-24 from the 5th
from Sun.

(4) House  vs  Arudha:  Sometimes,  an  arudha  pada  is  more  appropriate  to  see  a
matter than a house. For example, we can see darapada (A7) in D-24 to figure out
what  kind  of  people  one  typically  interacts  with  in  one’s  learning  related
activities. We can see one’s academic distinctions/awards in A5, because they are
maya  (illusion)  related  to  intelligence  and  scholarship.  The  world  forms  an
impression about one’s intelligence and scholarship based on one’s scores, ranks,
grades, distinctions and awards.

(5) Influences: After we choose a house/arudha in a divisional chart to represent the
matter  of  interest,  the  next  step  is  to  analyze  the  influences  on  it.  Planets
influence it with rasi drishti and graha drishti. We should also check for argala.
We  should  judge  the  meaning  of  each  influence.  We  can  also  judge  the
influences on a house by finding houses with respect to that house. Planets in the
quadrants  from  a  house  sustain  it.  Planets  in  trines  from  a  house  let  it  prosper.
Planets  in  upachayas  let  it  grow.  Planets  in  dusthanas  bring  obstacles.  Suppose
we  are  analyzing  A3  in  an  author’s  D-10.  While  the  3rd  house  shows  one’s
writing skills, it is A3 that shows one’s books. If a planet is in a quadrant from
A3, its periods may result in book writing. If a planet is in the 8th house from A3,
its  periods  may  bring  obstacles  in  book  writing.  If  a  planet  is  a  baadhaka  from
A3, it can create troubles in book-writing.

(6) Standard Results: There are many standard results given in literature for various
planets and house lords in various houses. These results should be mastered.

Attention  should  be  paid  to  the  strength  and  avasthas  of  various  planets  and
ashtakavarga strength of various houses. The presence of yogas should also be noted.

13.4.2  Family Members

We  can  analyze  the  fortunes  of  family  members  from  one’s  chart.  For  parents,
grandparents,  uncles  and  aunts,  we  should  see  D-12.  For  children,  children-in-law
and  grandchildren,  we  should  see  D-7.  For  brothers,  sisters,  brothers-in-law  and

Part 1: Chart Analysis

171

sister-in-law, we should see D-3. For spouse and his/her family members, we should
see D-9.

In each of these charts, we should look at the house that shows the person of interest
and consider the rasi containing the lord of that house as lagna. We can consider the
corresponding arudha pada also. For example, the 9th lord or the arudha pada of 9th
house  in  D-12  shows  father.  The  4th  lord  or  the  arudha  pada  of  4th  house  in  D-12
shows mother.

In  D-3,  we  see  siblings.  The  3rd  house  shows  younger  sibling  and  the  11th  house
shows  elder  sibling.  Being  the  3rd  from  the  3rd  house,  the  5th  house  shows  younger
brother’s  younger brother, i.e. second  younger brother. Being the 11th from the 11th
house, the 9th house shows elder brother’s elder brother, i.e. second elder brother. We
take the 3rd lord, 5th lord, 7th lord etc as lagnas of first (immediate) younger sibling,
second younger sibling, third younger sibling etc. We take the 11th lord, 9th lord, 7th
lord etc as lagnas of first (immediate) elder sibling, second elder sibling, third elder
sibling etc.

Similarly, the 5th house house shows children in D-7. The 7th house is the 3rd from 5th
and shows one’s child’s younger sibling. So the 5th lord shows the first child, the 7th
lord shows the second child, the 9th house shows the third child and so on.

When  we  count  houses  corresponding  to  siblings  and  children  in  D-3  and  D-7,  we
count  in  the  forward  or  backward  direction  based  on  whether  lagna  is  odd  or  even
(respectively). If lagna in D-7 is in Ge, Venus (lord of Li) shows first child, Jupiter
(lord of Sg) shows the second child and so on. On the other hand, if lagna in D-7 is
in Cn, Jupiter (lord of Pi) shows the first child, Saturn (lord of Cp) shows the second
child and so on.

NOTE: After covering all the odd or even signs, we move from odd to even signs or
even to odd signs, instead of coming back to where we started.

13.5  Examples

After  going  through  a  couple  of  examples,  readers  may  be  able  to  appreciate  the
process of interpreting charts.

  172

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 44: Let us consider the rasi chart given in Chart 13 and start making some
observations.

Lagna  in  Leo  can  show  someone  royal  and  authoritative.  Lagna  lord  Sun  is  in  the
10th house with 5th lord Jupiter. This forms a raaja yoga. With Jupiter in Uttamaamsa,
this  yoga  is  powerful.  Moreover,  this  yoga  takes  place  in  the  7th  from  AL.  That
makes it more powerful.

However, we note that debilitated Moon occupies AL in a Martian sign and Saturn
aspects him. Debilitated  Moon in AL shows that  the mind is turned away from the
material world. Saturn is the significator of hard-work, service and austerity and he
also  signifies  renunciation.  His  aspect  on  Moon  can  give  renunciation.  Moreover,
Saturn is with Ketu here. Overall, there are parivraaja yogas48 here. So this native is
likely to have renounced the world.

48 Parivraaja yogas are combinations that give renunciation of the material world.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

173

Chart 13

Saturn  is  the  planet  of  hard-work.  Ketu  is  the  planet  of  selflessness,  evolution  and
rising above the shackles of the material world. Venus is the planet of passion. If two

  174

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

of  these  planets  are  together  and  the  third  planet  aspects  them,  it  gives  Tapaswi49
yoga. If AK (chara atma karaka – soul) also aspects or conjoins the planets involved
in  Tapaswi  yoga,  this  tapas  will  be  more  fruitful  and  will  be  a  continuation  of  the
efforts of the past lives (AK is one’s link with the past lives).

Here  Saturn  and  Ketu  are  together  in  Virgo  and  exalted  Venus  aspects  them  from
Pisces.  This  gives  Tapaswi  yoga.  Tapaswi  yoga  is  particularly  powerful  when
formed  with  a  planet  in  the  8th  house  (hard-work,  research,  discovery  and  occult
knowledge). Here Venus is in the 8th house. AK is also involved in Tapaswi yoga.

So this native is likely to be a renunciate who did tapas in something and dedicated
his life to it. His soul is likely to have found its purpose in his tapas. However, at the
same time, there is a powerful rajayoga involving lagna lord and GL lord in the 7th
from  AL.  That  yoga  cannot  go  waste.  So  this  native  must’ve  enjoyed  some  power
and influence in the society.

Let  us  consider  his  D-20  now  (see  Chart  13).  D-20  shows  religious  and  spiritual
activities.  Lagna  is  in  Pisces  and  lord  Jupiter  is  in  the  9th  house.  This  shows
religiousness and also being guided by a brilliant guru/parampara. GL in D-20 is in
Sc and Jupiter occupies it. It shows a powerful position in religion.

If the 5th and 9th lords conjoin and aspect lagna, we learnt that it forms  a rajayoga.
Here 5th lord Moon and 9th lord Mars join in Vi and aspect lagna in Pi. This shows a
powerful  rajayoga  giving  a  powerful  and  prosperous  position  related  to  religious
matters.  Venus,  the  planet  of  passion,  is  in  the  8th  house  in  own  rasi.  That  shows
sincere  efforts  and  hard-work  in  religious  matters.  The  2nd  house  has  Sun  and
Mercury in it. The 2nd house shows speech among other things. Mercury is the planet
of speech and he has 6 rekhas in his D-20 BAV. Sun is a charismatic planet and he
has 5 rekhas in D-20 BAV. They together give Budha-Aaditya yoga in the house of
speech. The native is likely to be an excellent orator of religious matters.

This chart belongs to Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswathi, who was the chief pontiff
of Kanchi Kama Koti Peetham. He was a great scholar and a keen student of many
subjects. He was a true tapaswi and made a Herculean contribution in restoring the
place  of  Vedic  knowledge  in  Indian  society.  He  was  a  brilliant  orator.  He

49  Tapaswi  is  a  person  who  performs  tapas.  He  forgets  everything  and  pursues  something  single-
mindedly. Tapaswis usually dedicate themselves to research and uncover the secrets of the world. A
tapaswi can be into yoga, mantra, tantra, astrology or even physics or chemistry.

commanded  the  respect  of  presidents,  prime  ministers,  chief  ministers  and  millions
of Indians.

Chart 14

  176

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 45: Let us consider the D-3 chart of Late Rajiv Gandhi (see Chart 14).

Based  on  his  D-3,  let  us  try  to  say  something  about  his  younger  Sanjay  Gandhi.
Lagna in D-3 is in Sg, an odd sign. So we count houses normally. The 3rd house is
Aq.  Saturn  is  its  lord  and  we  should  take  Li  as  lagna  in  Rajiv  Gandhi’s  D-3  to
analyze Sanjay Gandhi’s fortune.

Lagna  has  exalted  Saturn  in  it.  This  shows  Sasa  yoga.  This  shows  someone  with
many loyal followers. The 10th house has 5th lord Rahu. If the 5th lord is in 10th, it can
show power. Because it is Rahu, it can show forceful nature in career. However, the
10th lord Moon is in a fiery sign in the 3rd house with Jupiter and Venus, two rank
benefics. The 3rd house shows one’s parakrama (boldness and initiative). This shows
a very positive and pro-active attitude. It shows a doer.

It may be interesting to note the similarities between Rajiv Gandhi’s D-3 and Sanjay
Gandhi’s rasi chart (shown in Chart 14). In both, Saturn is on the lagna axis. In the
former, Saturn is in lagna and Saturn owns lagna in the latter. In the former, Moon
owns  10th  and  joins  Jupiter  and  Venus.  In  the  latter,  Jupiter  and  Venus  are  in  10th,
aspected by Moon. In the former, 5th lord Rahu is in 10th. In the latter, Rahu is in 5th
and  aspects  10th.  In  the  former,  Sun  is  in  own  sign  in  11th,  aspected  by  Mercury,
Saturn and Ketu. In the latter, Sun, Mercury and Ketu are in 11th and Saturn aspects
them. In both, Mars is in the 12th house.

Usually, we have such links between the charts of related people.

Example  46:  Let  us  consider  the  D-24  charts  (see  Chart  15)  and  D-27  charts  (see
Chart  16)  of  twins  Satyam  Gaur  and  Shivam  Gaur,  who  were  born  just  2  minutes
apart.  They  have  the  same  rasi  chart,  but  Satyam  Gaur  was  a  brilliant  student  and
Shivam  Gaur  was  a  mediocre  student.  Satyam  studied  commerce  and  accountancy
and  scored  well.  Shivam  was  a  mediocre  student  except  in mathematics.  Satyam  is
jovial, amicable and optimistic. Shivam is a skeptic. He does not believe in astrology
and always seeks rational explanations. Let us try to explain these facts.

D-24  is  the  chart  that  shows  education.  In  Satyam’s  case,  lagna  is  in  Li  and  lagna
lord Venus is well-placed in a trine in a friendly house. Moreover, the sign occupied
by  lagna  lord  is  Ge,  an  intellectual  sign.  Mercury  is  in  the  5th  house  and  that  gives
good memory and intelligence. It also gives skills in commerce and accounting.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

177

Chart 15

  178

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 16

Part 1: Chart Analysis

179

Moreover, AL has Mercury and it shows a person who is perceived as an intellectual
person as far as learning goes. Mars in 6th, Venus in 5th and nodes in 11th are well-
placed from AL.

In Shivam’s D-24, lagna moved to Sc and lagna lord is debilitated. The strength of
lagna and lagna lord is very important in any chart. Moreover, 5th lord Jupiter is also
debilitated. Still, exalted Ketu’s aspect on Pi, the 5th house, gave him some skills in
mathematics.  But  the  debilitation  of  lagna  lord  and  5th  lord  makes  him  a  mediocre
student.  From  AL  also,  Mars  in  7th,  Venus  in  6th,  nodes  in  12th  are  badly  placed.
Malefics  in  3rd,  6th  and  11th  from  AL  and  benefics  in  trines  from  it  will  give  good
results.

To see one’s inherent nature, strengths and weaknesses, we  should look at D-27. In
Satyam’s D-27, lagna is in Ge and lagna lord Mercury aspects it. This gives Bhadra
yoga like results. The 5th house of emotions and judgment is Libra and its lord Venus
occupies it. This strength of lagna  and 5th house made him a very jovial, amicable,
cheerful and balanced person.

On the other hand, lagna in Shivam’s D-27 is in Cn. Lagna lord Moon is debilitated
in  the  5th  house  of  emotions.  This  gives  an  unhappy  spirit.  The  5th  house  shows
emotions  and  judgment  and  the  5th  lord  Mars  is  in  Vi.  The  8th  lord  (skepticism)
Saturn  has  an  aspect  with  him  from  Pi.  This  makes  him  skeptical  and  depressed.
Mars in taamasik and analytical sign Vi, with an aspect with 8th lord, makes him seek
rational explanations for everything.

13.6  Conclusion

In  this  chapter,  we  tried  to  recapitulate  what  we  learnt  in  the  previous  chapters.  A
couple of examples were given to illustrate the process of interpreting charts. In the
rest of the book, we will see many more examples.

14.  Topics Related to Longevity

14.1  Introduction

Many human beings are curious about how long they will live. An ethical astrologer
will not scare a client by predicting death, but he may caution a client gently before
critical  periods  and  suggest  some  remedial  measures  to  ward  off  an  impending
danger. An estimation of longevity is also helpful in matchmaking. After all, if one
person  will  live  for  81  years  and  the  other  only  for  36  years,  it  is  not  advisable  to
approve a match between those two people. In matchmaking, it is desirable that the
bridegroom and the bride have comparable longevity.

In  this  chapter,  we  will  study  some  basic  tools  that  are  used  in  longevity
determination  techniques.  There  are  formulas  for  determining  longevity,  based  on
ashtakavarga. But they do not always work and they will not be covered in this book.
We  will  cover  the  estimation  of  longevity  based  on  natal  chart  and  dasas.  Though
there are many dasas that help us in timing death, we will cover only Shoola dasa in
this book.

14.2  Marakas (Killers)

Each chart has some rasis and planets that are called marakas (killers). Since death is
an  event  relating  to  the  physical  existence,  rasi  chart  is  of  utmost  importance  in
seeing death. Rudramsa (D-11) shows the forces of death and destruction and it can
also  give  insight  into  death.  D-30  shows  one’s  evils  and  punishment  for  the  evils.
Death  can  be  a  punishment  for  one’s  evils  and  so  we  should  look  at  D-30  also.
However, the most important chart is the rasi chart.

The  3rd  and  8th  houses are  the  houses  of  life. The  3rd  house  shows the  vitality  of
one’s  existence  and  the  8th  house  shows  the  longevity.  The  12th  house  from  any
house shows losses related to the matters signified by that house. So the 12th house
from  these  two  houses  shows  death.  So  the  2nd  and  7th  houses  are  the  houses  of
death. For good longevity, the 3rd and 8th houses and their lords should be strong and
the 2nd and 7th houses and their lords should be weak.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

181

The  rasis  containing  the  2nd  and  7th  houses  are  called  maraka  sthanas  (killer
stations). When we use rasi-ruled dasas that can show death, dasas of these rasis can
bring  death.  Lords  of  the  2nd  and  7th  houses  are  called  maraka  grahas  (killer
planets). When we use planet-ruled dasas that can show death, dasas of these planets
can bring death.

There  are  other  maraka  grahas  too.  If  a  malefic  planet  powerfully  conjoins  or
aspects, using graha drishti, the 2nd and 7th houses or their lords, then it qualifies as a
maraka graha. Let us look at an example. Suppose lagna is in Le, Saturn is in Sg and
Mars  is  in  Ge.  Then  Saturn  is  a  maraka  on  account  of  owning  the  7th  house  (Aq).
Mars is a malefic and he is in Ge. He aspects the 2nd house (Vi, with the 4th house
aspect) and the 7th lord (Saturn in Sg – with the 7th house aspect). Because of these
two factors, Mars is a maraka. Let us take another example. Suppose lagna is in Pi,
Mars is in Ge, Mercury is in Cp and Saturn is in Ar. On account of owning the 2nd
and  7th  houses,  Mars  and  Mercury  are  marakas.  Look  at  Saturn.  He  is  in  the  2nd
house  and  aspects  the  2nd  lord  Mars  (with  the  3rd  house  aspect)  and  the  7th  lord
Mercury (with the 10th house aspect). So Saturn is also a maraka and he may in fact
be a stronger maraka than Mars and Mercury.

When  we  time  one’s  death  using  a  dasa,  we  should  look  for  the  involvement  of
maraka  sthanas  and  maraka  grahas.  We  can  also  use  marakas  when  timing  death
using the transits of planets.

14.3  Rudra, Trishoola and Maheswara

In  Indian  mythology,  there  are  eleven  Rudras.  They  are  all  different  forms  of  Lord
Shiva. They bring suffering and death to a native. Trishoola or trident is the weapon
of  Lord  Shiva.  Maheswara  is  the  Supreme  form  of  Lord  Shiva  and  he  gives
emancipation to the soul.

For every person, there are eleven rasis that represent the eleven Rudras. These rasis
bring suffering related to various areas of life.

Out of all the eleven Rudras, the one who brings suffering to the physical self is the
most important one. In each chart, there is one planet that plays this role. That planet
is simply called “Rudra”. That planet stands for the suffering and destruction of the

  182

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

native. There are three rasis designated as Trishoola rasis and they bring death. Let
us see the astrological defintions.

Table 32: Eighth House for Rudra Calculation
Ar  Ta  Ge  Cn  Le  Vi  Li  Sc  Sg  Cp  Aq  Pi
The 8th house  Sc  Ge  Cp  Sg  Cn  Aq  Ta  Sg  Cn  Ge  Cp  Le

Rasi

Rudra

Consider the lord of the 8th house from (i) lagna and (ii) the 7th house. Find the 8th
house using Table 32 and not in the normal way50. The stronger of the two planets
becomes Rudra. If the weaker planet is afflicted, it can also become Rudra. We say
that a planet is stronger if it conjoins more planets. If both planets conjoin the same
number  of  planets,  a  planet  in  exaltation  or  own  rasi  is  stronger.  A  planet  joining
exalted  planets  is  stronger.  A  planet  aspected  by  many  planets  (rasi  aspect)  is
stronger. Finally, a planet which is more advanced in its rasi is stronger. We find the
stronger planet in this manner and it becomes Rudra. However, if the weaker planet
is  debilitated  or  in  an  inimical  sign  and  conjoined/aspected  by  malefics  like  Mars,
Saturn, Rahu and Ketu, then it becomes Rudra.

Trishoola Rasis

The  three  trines  from  the  rasi  occupied  by  Rudra  in  rasi  chart  represent  the  three
spikes  of  Shiva’s  Trishoola/trident.  They  are  called  Trishoola  rasis.  Depending  on
whether a native has short life or middle life or long life, one of the three Trishoola
rasis kills the native during its Shoola dasa.

Maheswara

The  lord  of  the  8th  house  from  AK  (chara  atma  karaka)  is  called  Maheswara.  AK
stands  for  the  soul  and  the  8th  lord  from  him  stands  for  the  liberation  of  soul.  He
represents the channels through which one’s soul strives for liberation.

50  For  odd  rasis,  we  count  houses  zodiacally.  For  even  rasis,  we  count  houses  anti-zodiacally.  For
Brahma and Vishnu rasis, we use the regular motion. For Shiva rasis, we use Shiva’s motion. That is
how Table 32 is constructed. Shiva’s rasis and Shiva’s motion will be discussed in “Narayana Dasa”.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

183

There are a couple of exceptions:

(1) If the 8th lord from AK is in own rasi or exaltation rasi, then take the stronger of
the 8th and 12th lords from him. Suppose AK is Mars and he is in Ge. Then the 8th
house  from  AK  is  Cp  and  Saturn  is  Maheswara.  Now  let  us  say  that  Saturn  is
exalted  in  Li.  From  Saturn  (Li),  Venus  owns  the  8th  house  (Ta)  and  Mercury
owns  the  12th  house  (Vi).  The  stronger  of  Mercury  and  Venus  becomes
Maheswara.

(2) If Rahu or Ketu joins AK or the 8th from him, then we find the 6th lord from AK
instead of the 8th lord. Please note that this is equivalent to taking the 8th lord in
the anti-zodiacal order. Suppose AK is Mars and he is in Taurus. Then Sg is the
8th house from Mars and Jupiter, lord of Sg, becomes Maheswara. Now, suppose
Ketu is in Ta or Sg. Because of Ketu’s presence, we find the 6th house from Mars
instead of the 8th house. It is Li. Venus owns it and he becomes Maheswara.

(3) If  Rahu  becomes  Maheswara,  we  take  Mercury  instead.  If  Ketu  becomes

Maheswara, we take Jupiter instead.

14.4  The Method of Three Pairs

This method allows us to determine the approximate range of one’s longevity. In this
method, we look at 3 pairs of planets/mathematical points. In each pair, we look at
the two planets and see if they occupy a movable or fixed or dual rasi. Using Table
33, we look at the longevity category corresponding to the combination.

(1) Lagna lord and 8th lord (find the 8th house and its lord using Table 32)
(2) Moon and Saturn
(3) Lagna and Horalagna (HL)

Table 33: Longevity Category for Each Pair

Combination 2

Middle life
Short life

  184

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Long life means 72-108 years. Middle life means 36-72 years. Short life means 0-36
years. We learnt how to find the longevity category corresponding to each pair. Now,
we  should  learn  how  the  results  of  the  three  pairs  can  be  combined  for  one  final
result.

If all the three pairs result in the same longevity category, that will be the combined
classification. If two pairs give one result and the third pair gives a different result,
then  the  result  given  by  two  pairs  dominates.  Parasara  gave  further  hints  regarding
this  case  and  suggested  finding  the  maximum  longevity  (paramaayush)  of  a  person
using Table 34.

Table 34: Paramaayush Reckoner

If all the three pairs give three different results (i.e. one giving short life, one giving
middle life and one giving long life), then we should give preference to the third pair
of  lagna  and  horalagna.  However,  if  Moon  is  in  lagna  or  the  7th  house,  then  the
second pair of Moon and Saturn should be given preference.

Example 47: Let us say that lagna is in Ta, HL is in Ar, Moon is in Ta, Mercury is in
Cn, Venus is in Cp, and Saturn is in Ge.

Pair 1: Lagna lord Venus is in Cp, a movable rasi. The 8th house is in Ge (see Table
32)  and  Mercury  owns  it.  He  is  in  Cn,  another  movable  rasi.  Looking  for  the
combination “Movable + Movable” in the table, we see that “long life” is the result.

Pair  2:  Moon  is  in  Ta,  a  fixed  rasi.  Saturn  is  in  Ge,  a  dual  rasi.  Looking  for  the
combination “Fixed + Dual” in the table, we see that “long life” is the result.

Pair 3: Lagna in Ta, a fixed rasi. Horalagna is in Ar, a movable rasi. Looking for the
combination “Movable + Fixed” in the table, we see that “middle life” is the result.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

185

We see that two pairs indicate long life and one pair indicates middle life. So “long
life”  dominates  and  the  native  has  long  life.  Using  Table  34,  we  see  that  the
paramaayush for this case is 108 years.

14.5  The Eighth Lord Method

Parasara  and  Jaimini  prescribed  another  method  for  estimating  the  longevity
category. Find the stronger of lagna and 7th house and take it as the reference. Find
the 8th lord from it and see where he is placed from it. If he is in a quadrant, long life
is indicated. If he is in a panaphara, middle life is indicated. If he is in an apoklima,
short life is indicated.

Example 48: Let us say that lagna is in Ar and Li is stronger than Ar. Then we take
Li  as  the  reference.  The  8th  lord  is  Venus.  If  Venus  is  in  Li,  Cp,  Ar  or  Cn  (i.e.  a
quadrant  from  Li),  it  shows  long  life.  If  Venus  is  in  Sc,  Aq,  Ta  or  Le  (i.e.  a
panaphara  from  Li),  it  shows  middle  life.  If  Venus  is  in  Sg,  Pi,  Ge  or  Vi  (i.e.  an
apoklima from Li), it shows short  life.

Exercise 23: Consider the rasi chart shown in Chart 8. Identify the maraka planets in
this  chart.  Find  Rudra,  Trishoolas  and  Maheswara.  Finally  estimate  the  longevity
category of the native using the method of three pairs and the eighth lord method.

14.6  Conclusion

The  definitions  and  methods  given  in  this  chapter  will  be  useful  in  timing  death
using  dasas.  The  two  methods  of  outlined  here  for  determining  the  longevity
category  are  not  infallible.  There  are  some  exceptions  not  covered  in  this  book.  So
one should not be biased by these calculations.

It is worthwhile to emphasize once more that this knowledge should not be misused
for fame or for scaring clients. One should only gently caution clients and prescribe
remedial measures. Sages have warned that one misusing the knowledge of astrology
will live in misery and distress.

14.7  Answer to Exercise

Exercise 23:

Marakas:  Jupiter  and  Venus  own  the  2nd  and  7th  houses.  Rahu  is  in  the  7th  house.
These  three  planets  are  the  main  marakas.  Mercury  owns  8th  and  joins  Jupiter  and
Venus. So he may also be considered a maraka.
Rudra  &  Trishoola:  The  8th  house  from  lagna  is  Sg  (see  Table  32)  and  its  lord  is
Jupiter. The 8th house from Ta (the 7th house) is Ge and its lord is Mercury. Mercury
is  stronger,  as  he  is  more  advanced  in  his  rasi.  He  is  Rudra.  Rudra  is  in  Libra.  So
Trishoola (Destroyer Shiva’s trident) has spikes in Ge, Li and Aq.
Maheswara: Mercury is AK. The 8th from him is Ta. The 8th from him has Rahu. So
we take the 6th from Li and get Pi. Its lord Jupiter is Maheswara.
Method  of  Three  pairs:  Lagna  lord  and  8th  lord  show  middle  life  (fixed+movable).
Moon  and  Saturn  show  middle  life  (fixed+movable).  Lagna  and  horalagna  show
short life (fixed+fixed). So the longevity category is “middle life” (36-72 years). The
native died at the age of 50 years.
The Eighth Lord Method: Lagna is stronger than the 7th house. So let us take Sc as
the reference. The 8th lord from it is Mercury. He is in an apoklima from Sc (12th). So
the result is “short life”. This method did not work here.

15.  Strength of Planets and Rasis

15.1  Introduction

When  judging  the  results  given  by  houses  and  planets,  we  have  to  judge  their
strength. Sometimes we have to compare the strength of two planets and see which
one will dominate. For example, when finding the arudha pada of a house falling in
Scorpio, we learnt that we have to take the stronger of Mars and Ketu as the lord of
Scorpio.  In  several  rasi  dasas,  dasas  start  from  the  stronger  of  lagna  and  the  7th
house.  We  need  to  be  able  to  compare  them  and  judge  which  is  stronger.  A  house
may be influenced by several planets and they may suggest contradictory results. In
such a case, we need to decide which influence dominates.

There are different ways of measuring the strengths of planets and rasis for different
purposes. We will learn some of them in this section.

15.2  Why Different Strengths

Why  do  we  need  different  strengths  for  different  purposes?  Why  can’t  we  use  the
same strength? To understand this, let us consider an analogy.

Suppose  X  is  an  engineer.  Suppose  Y  is  another  engineer  with  exactly  the  same
background  and  suppose  Y  comes  to  the  house  of  X  for  a  few  days.  Suppose  Y
sleeps  in  the  afternoon  and  X  doesn’t.  Suppose  it  is  1  pm  and  Y  is  ready  for  his
afternoon nap. Suppose the two engineers have promised a charity in town that they
would give a big donation together and suppose someone from the charity comes to
X’s  house.  Because  it  is  not  his  house  and  because  he  is  sleepy,  Y  is  probably  not
going to play a prominent role and X is probably going to talk pleasantries and then
give a check on behalf of Y and himself. The money is both his and Y’s, but X is in a
better position to handle it. Shadbalas are similar to this. When two or more planets
take part in a yoga, the one that is stronger as per shadbala ends up giving the results.

  188

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Both  X  and  Y  may  have  to  deal  with  contractors,  workers  and  vendors  for  their
professional work. If Y has better relations with the people he deals with, he will be
more productive at his work as an engineer. Similarly, strength as per ashtakavarga
shows  the  ability  of  planets  to  deliver  their  goods  in  harmony  with  other  planetary
forces  at  work  in  a  chart.  Even  if  a  planet  has  good  shadbala,  it  will  be  unable  to
deliver  its  goods  if  it  is  at  odds  with  other  planets  in  the  chart,  i.e.  has  a  low
ashtakavarga strength.

An engineer who has good relations with workers, vendors and contractors related to
one  project  may  not  go  along  well  with  people  involved  in  another  project.  In  that
case,  he  will  produce  excellent  results  in  the  former  project  and  he  may  not  be
effective in the latter. Similarly, a planet may have good ashtakavarga strength in one
divisional  chart  and  poor  ashtakavarga  strength  in  another  divisional  chart.  Then  it
will give its results more effectively in the area of life related to the first chart.

Despite good capabilities and potential to get work done, Y may be unable to get his
work  done  if  he  is  depressed  about  something  or  if  he  is  absent-minded  for  some
reason. If he is in a cheerful state, he may get his work done well. Thus the state one
is  in  decides  one’s  final  output.  Similarly,  a  planet  must  be  in  a  good  “avastha”
(state) to give good results. There are different kinds of states – states related to age,
states related to alertness, states related to mood and states related to activity.

When  one  hires  an  engineer  as  an  employee  or  when  one  assigns  a  project  to  an
engineer, one is concerned about how effective he will be in the project. But suppose
one is considering the same engineer as a partner in business. Then his effectiveness
in a particular project does not matter much. What matters now is how well rounded
he is. He should have good overall knowledge of various projects. Vimsopaka bala is
analogous  to  this.  When  we  consider  the  overall  effectiveness  of  a  planet  in  one’s
life,  we  no  longer  look  at  its  effectiveness  to  give  results  in  a  specific  area  of  life.
Instead, we look at Vimsopaka bala. It shows the overall strength of a planet and its
ability to play an important role in one’s life (rather than a specific area of life).

If X and Y have to decide who eats a cake first or who gets to drink the only can of
soft drink left in the refrigerator, they are probably not going to argue about it. Their
qualifications or productivity at work or mental state or overall ability are not going
to matter. For something so trivial, they will probably toss a coin or have a friendly
arm-wrestling or simply do what their friends present in the room suggest. If Y has
more  friends  in  the  room  and  they  say  “let  Y  have  it”,  then  Y  is  going  to  have  it.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

189

Similarly,  for  trivial  things  like  determining  who  initiates  dasas,  antardasas  etc,  we
have  very  simple  rules  that  are  different  from  shadbala,  ashtakavarga  bala,  avastha
bala, Vimsopaka bala etc.

As  it  has  been  emphasized  many  times  in  this  book,  Vedic  astrology  has  a  rich
variety of parameters, tools and techniques. Attempting to use various techniques in
an  interchangable  manner  only  leads  to  confusion.  One  should  strive  to  understand
the meanings of various parameters and tools and use the right set of parameters and
tools  for  the  occasion.  Though  we  have  different  ways  of  measuring  a  planet’s
strength,  their  meanings  are  different  and  accordingly  they  are  used  for  different
purposes. We will learn the most common ones in this chapter.

15.3  Shadbala and Astakavarga Bala

There are six sources of strength – strength due to placement, strength due to time,
strength  due  to  directions,  strength  due  to  aspects,  strength  due  to  motion  and
strength  due  to  inherent  nature.  Shadbala  is  a  measure  of  the  strength  of  a  planet
based  on  these  six  sources  of  strength.  Explaining  the  computation  of  shadbalas  is
beyond the scope of this book. For the details of its computation, one may  refer to
“Brihat  Parasara  Hora  Sastram”  by  Parasara  or  “Graha  and  Bhava  Balas”  by  Dr.
B.V.  Raman.  Most  computer  software  programs  give  shadbala,  though  there  are
minor differences between the definitions used by them.

When  two  or  planets  influence  the  same  house  or  when  they  participate  in  a  yoga,
then  the  planet  with  the  highest  shadbala  is  the  most  likely  give  the  results.  The
planet  with  the  strongest  shadbala  is  like  a  group  leader  who  acts  on  the  group’s
behalf.

On the other hand, ashtakavarga bala shows how other planets support or oppose a
planet. It does not show how capable the planet is of leading and giving the results of
a  group  of  planets,  unlike  shadbala.  It  shows  how  capable  a  planet  is  of  giving  its
own results, in harmony with other planetary forces.

15.4  Avasthas (States)

  190

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Avastha literally means “state”. There are different possible states of a planet and we
will learn them in this section.

15.4.1  State Related to Age

One of the states of a planet has to do with its age. Just as a 10-year old child or an
80-year old man have their limitations and cannot execute certain tasks efficiently, a
planet in childhoos or old age may not be very effective.

A planet at 23º in Cn will be in Kumaara avastha (adolescence) and it will give half
of its results. A planet at 19º in Li will be in Vriddha avastha (old age) and it will not
be very  effective. A planet at 14º in Sg will be in Yuva avastha (young age) and it
will give all of its results. A planet at 27º in Pi will be at Saisava avastha (childhood)
and it will give one quarter of its results.

One  should  not  be  carried  away  with  these  avasthas.  Just  as  there  are  some  child
prodigies and wizards with wrinkles, a planet can give good results irrespective of its
age-related  state.  Age  is  just  one  of  the  factors  deciding  a  person’s  productivity.
Similarly, age-related state is just one of the factors deciding a planet’s effectiveness.

15.4.2  State Related to Alertness

We have 3 alertness-related states of planets:

(1)  A  planet  in  its  exaltation  rasi  or  an  own  rasi  is  said  to  be  in  “Jaagrita”  avastha

(awake). It gives full results.

(2)  A planet in a rasi owned by a neutral) or friendly planet is said to be in “Swapna”

avastha (dreaming). It gives medium results.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

191

(3)  A  planet  in  its  debilitation  rasi  or  a  rasi  owned  by  an  enemy  is  said  to  be  in

“Sushupta” avastha (asleep). The results it gives are negligible.

15.4.3  State Related to Attitude and Mood

We have 9 states of planets that are related to attitude and mood :

(1)  A planet in its exaltation rasi is said to be in “Deepta” avastha (bright).

(2)  A planet in its own rasi is said to be in “Swastha” avastha (doing well, contented,

comfortable, natural).

(3)  A planet in a good friend’s rasi is said to be in “Mudita” avastha (delighted).

(4)  A planet in a friend’s rasi is said to be in “Saanta” avastha (peaceful).

(5)  A  planet  in  a  neutral  planet’s  rasi  is  said  to  be  in  “Deena”  avastha  (sad,

depressed).

(6)  A  planet  in  an  enemy’s  rasi  is  said  to  be  in  “Duhkhita”  avastha  (distressed,

miserable).

(7)  A  planet  joined  by  malefic  planets  is  said  to  be  in  “Vikala”  avastha  (crippled,

confused).

(8)  A planet in a malefic planet’s rasi is said to be in “Khala” avastha (mischievous,

scheming).

(9)  A planet joined closely by Sun is said to be in “Kopita” avastha (angry).

We have 6 additional states of planets that are related to attitude and mood :

(1) A planet in the 5th house joined by Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu is said to

be in “Lajjita” avastha (ashamed).

(2) A  planet  in  its  exaltation  rasi  or  moolatrikona  rasi  is  said  to  be  in  “Garvita”

avastha (proud).

(3) A planet is in an enemy’s rasi or conjoined by enemies or aspected by enemies or

conjoined by Saturn, it is said to be in “Kshudhita” avastha (hungry).

(4) A planet stationed in a watery rasi and aspected by enemies without the aspect of

benefics is said to be in “Trishita” avastha (thirsty).

  192

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(5) A  planet  in  a  friend’s  sign,  conjoined  or  aspected  by  friends  and  conjoined  by

Jupiter, is said to be in “Mudita” avastha (delighted).

(6) A planet conjoined by Sun and aspected by malefics or enemies is said to be in

“Kshobhita” avastha (shaken, agitated).

Planets  give  results  based  on  the  state  they  are  in.  If  a  house  contains  planets  in
Kshudhita  or  Kshobhita  avasthas,  the  significations  of  the  house  are  affected.  If  a
planet in the 5th house is in Lajjita avastha, there may be losses related to progeny. If
a planet in the 7th house is in Kshobhita avastha, there may be loss of spouse.

15.4.4  States Relates to Activity

There are 12 possible states of a planet related to its activity. This state is the most
important  of  all  states.  For  each  planet,  we  use  the  following  formula  to  find  its
avastha.

Suppose C is the number of the constellation occupied by the planet (1 for Aswini, 2
for Bharani and so on).  Suppose P is the index of the planet whose avastha we are
finding  (1  for  Sun,  2  for  Moon).  Suppose  A  is  the  index  of  the  amsa  (navamsa)
occupied  by  the  planet  in  its  rasi51.  Suppose  M  is  the  constellation  occupied  by
Moon. Suppose G is the ghati running at birth.52 Suppose L is the rasi occupied by
lagna (1 for Ar, 2 for Ta and so on).  Then  we  compute (C  x P  x  A)  + M + G +  L,
divide  it  by  12  and  take  the  remainder.  Using  the  resulting  number  as  the  avastha
index and referring to Table 36, we find out the avastha of the planet.

22°14' in Ge is in the 7th navamsa of Ge (please note that we are not talking about the rasi occupied by
the planet in navamsa). Then we use A = 7 for Mercury.
52 Suppose sunrise was at 6 am and someone was born at 11 pm. So 17 hours were over. Each hour
has 2.5 ghatis and 17 hours = 17 x 2.5 = 42.5. So the 43rd ghati was running at birth.

After  we  find  the  avastha  index,  we  can  multiply  it  with  itself  and  add  the  number
corresponding to the first sound in the first syllable of the name, as found from Table
37. We can take the remainder when that number is divided by 12. Then we can add
a planetary adjustment to the remainder. We use 5 for Sun and Jupiter, 2 Moon and
Mars, 3 for Mercury, Venus and Saturn and 4 for Rahu and Ketu. We divide the sum
by  3  and  take  the  remainder.  This  gives  the  strength  of  the  activity.  A  value  of  1
means “drishti” and medium results. A value of 2 means “cheshta” and full results. A
value  of  3  (or  0)  means  “vicheshta”  and  gives  very  little  results.  Based  on  the
activity-related  state  of  a  planet,  we  can  guess  the  results  given  by  it.  Based  on
whether  it  is  in  Cheshta,  Drishti  or  Vicheshta,  the  results  will  be  full,  medium  or
little. An example will clarify this computation.

Mercury, Jupiter and Venus for this native. The native’s given name starts with “V”.

Moon is in Poorvabhadrapada, i.e. the 25th constellation. So M = 25. The native was
born  at  5:50  pm  and  sunrise  was  at  6  am.  So  11:50  hours  passed  since  sunrise.  In
minutes, this is 710 minutes. Because a ghati contains 24 minutes, this is 29.6 ghatis.
So the 30th ghati after sunrise was running at birth. So G = 30. Lagna is in Virgo, the

  200

6th  rasi  from  Aries  and  so  L  =  6.  The  native’s  given  name  starts  with  “V”  and  the
number corresponding to this sound is 1.

Mercury:  Mercury  is  at  3Ar08.  He  is  in  Aswini,  i.e.  1st  constellation.  So  C  =  1.
Because Mercury is the 4th planet from Sun, P = 4. Mercury is in the first 1/9th of Ar
and so A = 1. Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + G + L = (1 x 4 x 1) + 25 +
30 + 6 = 65. Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder of 5. From Table 36, we see that
an avastha index of 5 means “Gamana” avastha (going/on the move). We see that 5 x
5 is 25. Adding 1 (corresponding to the sound), we get 26. Remainder when this is
divided by 12 is 2. Adding 3 (Mercury’s planetary adjustment), we get 5. When we
divide  it  by  3,  remainder  is  2.  It  shows  “Cheshta”.  So  Mercury’s  results  due  to
“Gamana” avastha are  given in full. We see that the standard results are  “visits the
courts of kings frequently, wealthy”.

Jupiter:  Jupiter  is  at  9Li46.  He  is  in  Swaati,  i.e.  15th  constellation.  So  C  =  15.
Because Jupiter is the 5th planet from Sun, P = 5. Jupiter is in the third 1/9th of Li and
so A = 3. Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + G + L = (15 x 5 x 3) + 25 + 30
+ 6 = 286. Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder of 10. From Table 36, we see that
an avastha index of 10 means “Nriyalipsaa” avastha (urge for dance). We see that 10
x  10  is  100.  Adding  1  (corresponding  to  the  sound),  we  get  101.  Remainder  when
this  is  divided  by  12  is  5.  Adding  5  (Jupiter’s  planetary  adjustment),  we  get  10.
When we divide it by 3, remainder is 1. It shows “Drishti”. So Jupiter’s results due to
“Nriyalipsaa”  avastha  are  given  only  to  a  medium  extent. We  see  that  the  standard
results are: “honored by kings, wealthy, learned in dharma sastra and tantra, revered
by powerful men, respected by learned men, a scholar and faultless in grammar and
etymology”.

Venus: Venus is at 7Ar55. He is in Aswini, i.e. 1st constellation. So C = 1. Because
Venus is the 6th planet from Sun, P = 6. Venus is in the third1/9th of Ar and so A = 3.
Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + G + L = (1 x 6 x 3) + 25 + 30 + 6 = 79.
Dividing it by 12,  we  get a remainder of 7.  From Table 36, we see that an avastha
index  of  7  means  “Sabhaa”  avastha  (assemby/council).  We  see  that  7  x  7  is  49.
Adding 1 (corresponding to the sound), we get 50. Remainder when this is divided
by 12 is 2. Adding 3 (planetary adjustment of Venus), we get 5. When we divide it
by 3, remainder is 2. It shows “Cheshta”. So Venus’s results due to “Sabhaa” avastha
are  given  in  full.  We  see  that  the  standard  results  are  “eminent  in  a  king’s  court,
virtuous, destroyer of enemies, wealthy and charitable”.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

Exercise 24: Consider a gentleman born at 8:30 am (LMT) on 8th November 1927 at
67E03, 24N52. Find the activity-related states of Sun, Mars and Jupiter and interpret
them. His name starts with the sound “L”.

Importance of Sayanaadi Avasthas:

Sayanaadi (Sayana etc) avasthas are the most important of all avasthas. In addition to
the results listed above, Parasara listed some special results. If a benefic is in Sayana
avastha, the house benefits from his presence. If a malefic is in Nidraa avastha in the
7th house without the conjunction or aspect of another malefic, it is auspicious. If a
malefic is in Bhojana avastha, the house containing it is destroyed. If a malefic is in
the 5th house in Sayana or Nidraa avastha, it is auspicious. If a malefic is in the 8th
house  in  Sayana  or  Nidraa  avastha,  it  brings  death  by  royal  wrath.  If  a  malefic
occupies the 10th house in Bhojana or Sayana avastha, all kinds of miseries may be
expected. If a benefic or a planet in own or exaltation rasi occupies in the 1st, 5th, 7th
or  10th  house  in  Prakasana,  Nrityalipsaa  or  Kautuka  avasthas,  it  brings  Raja  Yoga.
Parasara  specifically  mentioned  Moon  in  the  10th  house  in  Kautuka  or  Prakaasana
avasthas.

However, one should not be carried away with avasthas and one should remember
that  they  are  only  the  “states”  of  the  planet.  The  state  of  a  planet  related  to  age,
alertness, mood and activity will have a role in the results given by it, but the houses
influenced  by  it  in  various  divisional  charts  are  more  important  in  deciding  the
results.  We  should  avoid  the  temptation  to  make  predictions  based  on  thumbrules
and look-up tables.

15.5  Other Simple Strengths

15.5.1  Stronger Co-Lord

When we find the arudha pada of a house falling in Scorpio or Aquarius, we need to
find  the  stronger  of  Mars  &  Ketu  (co-lords  of  Sc)  and  Saturn  &  Rahu  (co-lords  of
Aq). The stronger lord acts its lord and decides the arudha pada. The stronger lord of
Sc  (or  Aq)  is  also  used  in  finding  the  duration  of  its  dasa  in  many  rasi  dasas  (e.g.
Narayana dasa).

  202

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Basic rule: If one of the co-lords is in the rasi, take the other planet. For example, if
Saturn is in Aq and Rahu is in a rasi other than Aq, Rahu becomes the primary lord
of Aq. If not, we find the stronger of the 2 planets and the stronger planet becomes
the primary lord.

The  stronger  planet  of  two  planets  is  determined  using  the  following  rules.  We  go
from one rule to the next, only if we do not have a winner.  If we have a winner in
one step, we do not go through the remaining steps.

(1) If  one  planet  is  joined  by  more  planets  than  the  other,  it  is  stronger.  Suppose
Saturn is in Pi with Mars and Sun and Rahu is in Ar with Jupiter. Then Saturn is
stronger  than  Rahu,  because  he  is  with  2  planets  and  Rahu  is  only  with  one
planet. So Saturn becomes the primary lord of Aq.

(2) We find how many of the following planets conjoin/aspect a planet: (1) Jupiter,
(2) Mercury, and, (3) dispositor. A planet conjoined/aspected by more of these 3
planets is stronger. We must use rasi aspects here. Suppose Saturn is in Ge with
Mercury,  Rahu  is  in  Ar,  Mars  is  in  Le,  Jupiter  is  in  Ta.  Saturn  is  conjoined  by
Mercury and his dispositor (who is Mercury again). His count is 2. Rahu in Ar is
aspected by Mars, his dispositor, from Le. Neither Jupiter nor Mercury aspects or
conjoins Rahu. So Rahu’s count of 1 loses to Saturn’s count of 2  and Saturn is
the stronger planet. He becomes the lord of Aq.

(3) If  one  planet  is  exalted  and  the  other  not,  then  the  exalted  planet  is  stronger.
Suppose  Saturn  is  in  Li  and  Rahu  is  in  Cn,  with  the  same  number  of  planets.
Suppose  we  have  a  tie  after  step  (2).  Then  we  note  that  Saturn  is  exalted  in  Li
and declare him as the stronger planet. He becomes the primary lord of Aq.

(4) If we have a tie after (3), we consider the natural strength of the rasi containing
the  planet.  Dual  rasis  are  stronger  than  fixed  rasis  and  fixed  rasis  are  stronger
than movable rasis. Suppose Mars is in Ge and Ketu is in Aq and we have a tie
between them after step (3). Then we declare Mars as the stronger planet and the
primary lord of Sc, because he is in a dual rasi and Ketu is in a fixed rasi.

(5) (a)  When  finding  dasa  duration:  If  we  have  a  tie  after  (4),  we  take  the  planet
giving  a  larger  length  for  dasa.  Supose  Saturn  is  in  Ge  and  Rahu  is  in  Vi  and
suppose  we  have  a  tie  after  (4).  Suppose  we  want  to  find  the  stronger  lord  for

Part 1: Chart Analysis

203

Narayana  dasa.  Rahu  in  Vi  gives  5  years  and  Saturn  in  Ge  gives  8  years53.  So
Saturn is used instead of Rahu.

(b) When finding the lord for arudha padas etc: If we have a tie after (4), we take
the  planet  that  is  more  advanced  in  its  rasi.  We  measure  the  advancement  of
Rahu and Ketu from the end of the rasi. Suppose Mars is at 23Li17 and Ketu is at
5Cn54.  Suppose  we  have  a  tie  after  (4).  Advancement  of  Mars  in  Li  is  23°17'.
Advancement of Ketu from the end of Cn is 30° – 5°54' = 24°6'. Because Ketu is
more advanced, Ketu is stronger than Mars and becomes the primary lord of Sc.

Exercise  25:  Find  the  primary  lord  of  Aq  and  Sc  in  Chart  12  for  the  purpose  of
arudha padas.

15.5.2  Stronger Rasi

When computing rasi dasas, we sometimes need to find the strongest rasi out of 2 or
3 or 4 rasis. In this book, we will mainly use Narayana dasa and we will only need to
compare the strengths of 2 rasis. To conclude that a rasi is stronger than another rasi
for the purpose of rasi dasas, we use the following rules. We use the same rules for
finding the stronger rasi owned by a planet, when computing its graha arudha. We go
from one rule to the next only if there is no winner after the rule. When we have a
winner, we stop and do not go to the next rule.

(1) If one rasi contains more planets than the other rasi, then it is stronger. Suppose
we  are  comparing  the  strengths  of  Ar  and  Li.  Suppose  Ar  contains  Saturn  and
Jupiter and Li contains Venus. Then Ar is stronger, as it contains more planets.

(2) We find how many of the following planets occupy/aspect a rasi: (1) Jupiter, (2)
Mercury,  and,  (3)  the  rasi’s  lord.  A  rasi  occupied/aspected  by  more  of  these  3
planets is stronger. We must use rasi aspects here. Suppose we are compring the
strengths  of  Ar  and  Li.  Suppose  Jupiter  is  in  Ar,  Mercury  and  Venus  are  in  Ta
and  Mars  is  in  Vi.  Then  Ar  is  occupied  by  Jupiter  and  not  by  the  other  two
(Mercury and lord Mars). Its count is 1. Li is aspected by two (Mercury and lord

53 We will learn the computation of dasa years in Narayana dasa later.

  204

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Venus)  and  only  Jupiter  doesn’t  aspect  it  (we  are  using  rasi  aspects).  So  Li’s
count of 2 beats Ar’s count of 1 and Li is stronger than Ar.

(3) If one rasi contains an exalted planet and the other does not, then the former rasi
is stronger. Suppose we are compring the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose Saturn
and  Mercury  are  in  Li  and  Jupiter  and  Venus  are  in  Ar.  Suppose  we  have  a  tie
between  Ar and  Li after rule (2). Then we note  that Saturn is exalted in Li and
declare Li as the stronger rasi.

(4) A rasi whose lord is in a rasi with a different oddity (odd/even) is stronger than a
rasi whose lord is in a rasi with the same oddity. Suppose we are compring the
strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose we have a tie after rule (3). Suppose Venus is in
Cn,  an  even  rasi  and  Mars  is  in  Le,  an  odd  rasi.  Both  Ar  and  Li  are  odd  rasis.
Because the lord of  Li is in an even rasi (i.e. a rasi with a different oddity) and
the lord of Ar is in an odd rasi (i.e. a rasi with the same oddity), Li is stronger.

NOTE:  If we have a tie upto rule (3) when finding the stronger rasi owned by  a
planet  for  computing  its  graha  arudha,  this  rule  will  surely  resolve  the  tie,
because  the  two  rasis  owned  by  each  planet  have  a  different  oddity.  So  one  of
them will have the lord in a rasi with a different oddity.

(5) If we have a tie after rule (4), we use the natural strength of rasis. Dual rasis are
stronger than fixed rasis and fixed rasis are stronger than movable rasis. This rule
is  not  useful  in  Narayana  dasa,  because  we  always  compare  a  rasi  and  the  7th
from  it.  If  a  rasi  is  dual/fixed/movable,  the  7th  from  it  is  also  of  the  same  type.
However, this rule is useful in some other dasas.

(6) If  we have  a tie after rule (5), we look at the longitudes of the lords of the two
rasis. We measure the advancement of each planet from the beginning of the rasi
occupied  by  it  (from  the  end  of  the  rasi  in  the  case  of  Rahu  and  Ketu)  and
compare  them.  The  rasi  owned  by  the  planet  with  the  higher  advancement  is
stronger. Suppose we are comparing the strengths of Ar and Li. Suppose we have
a  tie  after  rule  (5).  Suppose  Mars  is  at  23Ge17  and  Venus  is  at  19Le51.
Advancement of Mars (lord of Ar) in his rasi is 23°17'. Advancement of Venus
(lord  of  Li)  in  his  rasi  is  19°51'.  Because  Mars  is  more  advanced,  his  Ar  is
stronger than Li.

NOTE:  In  the  case  of  Aq  and  Sc,  we  use  the  stronger  lord.  For  Rahu  and  Ketu,
advancement in rasi is measured from the end of the rasi. If Rahu is at 9Sc34, his
advancement in Sc is 30° – 9°34' = 20°26'.

Part 1: Chart Analysis

205

Exercise 26: Consider Chart 12. Identify the stronger rasi from each pair below:
(1) Ar & Li, (2) Ta & Sc, (3) Ge & Sg, (4) Cn & Cp, (5) Le & Aq, and, (6) Vi & Pi.

Warning:  The  above  rules  are  too  general.  One  should  understand  the  meaning  of
each rule and adapt based on the situation. For example, aspect of Mercury, Jupiter
and  lord  is  important  for  Narayana  dasa  and  other  phalita  dasas.  In  ayur  dasas  that
show  longevity,  aspect  of  luminaries  (Sun  and  Moon)  are  important.  Aspect  of  all
other planets is equally important. There is no significance for the aspect of lord. In
dasas based on AK (e.g. Atmakaraka kendradi graha/rasi dasas), the sign containing
AK is stronger than any other rasi. After we check for the aspects of Mercury, Jupiter
and rasi lord, we should look at the placement of rasi lord from AK. A rasi who lord
is in a quadrant from AK is stronger than a rasi whose lord is in a panaphara from
AK. These rules, however, are not applicable to all dasas.

15.6  Anwers to Exercises

Exercise 24:

Sun  is  in  “Sabhaa”  avastha  and  his  strength  is  “Cheshta”.  His  results  are  “helps
others,  possesses  wealth,  gems  and  lands,  virtuous,  very  strong,  affectionate  and
kind”. They are given in full.

Mars  is  in  “Nidraa”  avastha  and  his  strength  is  “Drishti”.  His  results  are  “angry,
unintelligent, poor, wicked, fallen from the virtuous path, sick” and they are given to
a medium degree.

Jupiter is in “Aagama” avastha and his strength is “Cheshta”. His results are “many
conveyances,  comforts,  honors,  servants,  happiness  from  progeny,  knowledge,
friends, learning and noble path” and they are given in full.

Exercise 25:

Rahu is alone and Saturn is alone. We have a tie after rule (1). Saturn is aspected by
Mercury  and  not  aspected/conjoined  by  Jupiter  and  his  dispositor  (Jupiter  again).
Rahu is aspected by Venus (his dispositor) and not aspected by Mercury and Jupiter.
Both have a count of one and we have a tie after rule (2). Neither Saturn nor Rahu is

  206

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

exalted after rule (3). Now we use rule (4). Saturn is in a dual rasi and Rahu is in a
movable rasi. So Saturn is stronger and he becomes the primary lord of Aq.

Mars is in Sc and Ketu is elsewhere (in Ar). So we don’t even have to go through the
rules  to  find  the  stronger  planet.  We  use  the  “basic  rule”  and  declare  Ketu  as  the
primary lord of Sc.

Exercise 26:

(1)  Ar  and  Li  have  one  planet  each.  There  is  a  tie  in  rule  (1).  Ar  is  aspected  by
Jupiter  &  lord  Mars.  Li  is  aspected  only  by  lord  Venus.  Ar  is  stronger  than  Li,
from rule (2).

(2)  Sc has 2 planets and Ta has 1. Sc is stronger than Ta, from rule (1).
(3)  Sg has 2 planets and Ge is empty. Sg is stronger than Ta, from rule (1).
(4)  Cp has 1 planet and Cn is empty. Cp is stronger than Cn, from rule (1).
(5)  Le and Aq are empty. There is a tie after rule (1). Le is not aspected by any of
Jupiter, Mercury and lord Sun. Aq is aspected by co-lord Rahu (though Saturn is
the  primary/stronger  lord,  Rahu’s  aspect  also  counts).  Aq  is  stronger  than  Le,
from rule (2).

(6)  Pi has 1 planet and Vi is empty. Pi is stronger than Vi, from rule (1).

Part 2:   Dasa Analysis

One unique feature of Vedic astrology is its concept of “dasa”
systems. Dasa means “a period”. One’s lifetime is divided into
several periods, sub-periods, sub-sub-periods and so on. These
are  ruled  by  different  planets  or  rasis.  Planets  and  rasis  give
their  results  in  their  respective  periods  and  sub-periods.  Each
dasa  system  has  a  specific  use.  The  nature  of  results  given  by
planets  and  rasis  in  their  respective  periods  and  sub-periods
depends on the dasa system being used.

There are many classifications of dasa systems:

(1)  Nakshatra  dasas  and  Rasi  dasas:  Nakshatra  dasas  are
based on Moon’s nakshatra (constellation). Rasi dasas are
based  on  rasis  occupied  by  planets  and  dasas  are  owned
by rasis in rasi dasas.

(2)  Phalita dasas and Ayur dasas: Phalita means results and
ayur  means  longevity.  Phalita  dasas  are  used  for  general
results and ayur dasas are used for predicting death.

  208

Hundreds  of  dasa  systems  were  enumerated  by  the  seers  of
Vedic  astrologey.  Specific  uses  of  these  dasa  systems  weren’t
clearly  mentioned  in  classics.  These  are  hidden  in  remote
corners of India as family secrets.

16.  Vimsottari Dasa

16.1  Introduction

Vimsottari dasa is the most popular dasa system among Vedic astrologers of today.
Sage  Parasara  mentions  in  “Brihat  Parasara  Hora  Sastram”  that  this  dasa  system  is
the most suitable dasa system in Kali yuga.

Vimsottari means 120. Vimsottari dasa is a dasa system where the total duration of
the  dasa  cycle  is  120  years.  Dasas  of  different  planets  are  for  different  number  of
years, but the sum of all dasas is 120 years.

In Kali yuga, paramaayush (maximum longevity) of human beings is supposed to be
120 years. Consequently, Vimsottari dasa is the most suitable dasa in Kali yuga.

Dasas  are  reckoned  here  based  on  the  constellation  occupied  by  Moon.  There  are
other  variations  that  are  more  applicable  in  some  cases.  Many  contemporary  Vedic
astrologers  ignore  these  variations  and  always  reckon  dasas  from  the  lord  of  the
constellation occupied by Moon. However, this may not result in the best predictions
always. In this book, we will look at some of the variations.

One’s life is divided into dasas – periods – ruled by the nine planets. A dasa is also
called  a  “mahadasa”  (mahadasa  =  master  period).  Each  mahadasa  is  again  divided
into  9  sub-periods  ruled  by  9  planets.  These  sub-periods  in  mahadasas  are  called
“antardasas”.  We  can  divide  further.  Sub-periods
in  antardasas  are  called
“pratyantardasas”. Sub-periods in pratyantardasas are called “sookshma-antardasas”
or  simply  sookshma  dasas.  Sub-periods  in  sookshma  dasas  are  called  “prana-
antardasas”  or  simply  prana  dasas.  Sub-periods  in  prana  dasas  are  called  “deha-
antardasas”.  In  this  book,  we  will  denote  mahadasa  with  MD,  antardasa  with  AD,
pratyantardasa  with  PD,  sookshma  dasa  with  SD,  prana-antardasa  with  PAD  and
deha-antardasa with DAD.

16.2  Dasa Computation

The lengths of the dasas (periods) of various planets are given in Table 38. The order
of dasas is also as indicated in that table. For example, let us say that the first dasa is
Sun’s. It will be of 6 years. Then 10 years of Moon dasa will follow. Then 7 years of
Mars dasa will follow. And so on. At the end of the table, we come back to the first
entry. For example, let us say that the first dasa is of Jupiter. Then the order of dasas
will be Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun (go back), Moon, Mars and Rahu.

In this manner, we can find the order of dasas and dasa lengths, given the first dasa.

For computing Vimsottari dasa, use the following steps:

(1) Find the constellation occupied by Moon.

(2) Find the advancement of Moon in the constellation.

(3) Find the part of the constellation that is yet to be traversed by Moon, as a fraction
of the length of the constellation. [NOTE: Length of each constellation is 13°20'.]

(4) First dasa will belong to the lord of the constellation.

(5) Find the sequence of dasas and dasa lengths from Table 38.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

211

(6) Multiply the length of the first dasa by the fraction found in step (3). Only this

amount in the first dasa is left at birth. The rest was over before birth.

Controversy:  Dasa  length  of  each  planet  was  given  in  years  in  Table  38.  For
example, Sun dasa is for 6 years. However, what is the meaning of “a year” here? Do
we mean the normal solar year, i.e. 365.2425 days? Or, do we mean a savana year of
360 days that is used when finding the running year for calculating varsha bala (year
strength)  in  shadbalas?  Or,  do  we  mean  a  period  in  which  Moon  traverses  through
360  constellations?  Or,  do  we  mean  a  period  of  360  tithis  (luni-solar  days)?  Most
scholars, including this author’s guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, use solar years. However, this
author prefers savana years based on the teachings of his father. Savana years will be
used with nakshatra dasas in all the calculations given in this book. This is not meant
to be a recommendation.

Example 50: Let us say someone was born at 5:50 am on 2000 April 28 (time zone:
4 hours west of GMT). Moon is at 2°23' in Aq at the time of birth.
(1) This  is  in  the  3rd  pada  (quarter)  of  Dhanishtha  constellation.  Dhanishtha

constellation starts at 23°20' in Cp and ends at 6°40' in Aq.

(2) Moon’s advancement in Dhanishtha = 2Aq23 – 23Cp20 = 32°23' – 23°20' = 9°3'.
(3) The total length of the constellation is 13°20'. The length  yet to be traversed in
this  constellation  as  a  fraction  of  the  total  constellation  length  =  (13°20'  –
9°3')/13°20' = 4°17'/13°20' = (4x60+17)/(13x60+20) = 257/800 = 0.32125. This
is the fraction of the constellation yet to be traversed by Moon.

(4) First dasa belongs to the lord of Dhanishtha. It is Mars.
(5) Let us start from Mars. From Table 38, dasa sequence is: Mars (7  years), Rahu
(18  years),  Jupiter  (16  years),  Saturn  (19  years),  Mercury  (17  years),  Ketu  (7
years), Venus (20 years), Sun (6 years), Moon (10 years).

(6) First dasa needs a correction. Out of 7 years of Mars dasa, the amount left at birth
=  7  x  0.32125  =  2.24875  years  =  2  years  2  months  29  days  33  ghatis.  [NOTE:
Ghati = 1/60th of a day, i.e. 24 minutes.]

The native was born at 5:50 am on 2000 April 28. We can get the end date of Mars
dasa by adding 2 years 2 months 29 days 33 ghatis to it. We get about 7 pm on 2002
July 15. Mars dasa will be over then and Rahu dasa will start. We get Rahu dasa’s
end  date  by  adding  18  years  to  this  date.  Similarly,  we  can  find  the  start  and  end
dates of all dasas.

16.3  Antardasa Computation

Each  mahadasa  is  divided  into  9  antardasas.  Take  the  planet  ruling  the  mahadasa.
First  antardasa  will  belong  to  the  same  planet  and  antardasas  go  in  the  same
sequence  as  dasas.  The  complete  length  of  the  mahadasa  is  ditributed  among
antardasas in the ratio of mahadasa years of planets.

For example, let us take Venus dasa of the native of Example 50. Venus dasa runs
for 20 years. Antardasas in Venus dasa start from Venus and go in the order given in
Table  38.  So  antardasa  order  in  Venus  dasa  is  —  Venus,  Sun,  Moon,  Mars,  Rahu,
Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and Ketu. Length of Venus antardasa is 20/120 of the total
dasa length, i.e. 20x20/120 years = 3 years and 4 months. Length of Sun antardasa is
6/120  of  the  total  dasa  length,  i.e.  20x6/120  years  =  1  year.  Length  of  Moon
antardasa  is  10/120  of  the  total  dasa  length,  i.e.  20x10/120  years  =  1  year  and  8
months.  Length  of  Mars  antardasa  is  7/120  of  the  total  dasa  length,  i.e.  20x7/120
years = 1 year and 2 months. In this manner, we proportionally divide the period of a
mahadasa into 9 antardasas.

We  use  the  same  procedure  to  divide  each  antardasa  into  9  pratyantardasas,  each
pratyantardasa into 9 sookshma dasas and so on.

In the case of the first dasa, we don’t divide the remainder at birth (2.24875 years of
Mars  dasa  remainder,  for  example,  in  Example  50)  into  9  antardasas.  Instead,  we
divide the complete duration of the first dasa (7 years of Mars dasa, for example, in
Example  50)  into  9  antardasas.  So  a  few  antardasas  may  be  over  before  birth  and
only a few antardasas may be left at birth.

From now on, it will be assumed that the reader is familiar with the computations. If
the reader does not have any software and needs to compute dasas by hand, he or she
should practice with many charts.

16.4  Vimsottari Dasa Variations

16.4.1  Computation of Variations

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

213

We always compute the fraction left at birth in the first dasa based on the fraction of
the constellation occupied by Moon, that is  yet to be traversed by Moon. However,
we need not always take the lord of Moon’s constellation as the planet ruling the first
dasa.  We  can  take  the  lord  of  the  4th,  5th  or  8th  constellation  from  Moon’s
constellation  to  start  the  first  dasa.  These  3  stars  are  called  kshema,  utpanna  and
adhana stars.

Example 51: Let us consider the data of Example 50 and calculate Vimsottari dasa
from 4th, 5th and 8th stars.

The  4th  star  from  Moon’s  star  is  Uttarabhadrapada  owned  by  Saturn.  Using  the  4th
star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa sequence as — Saturn, Mercury, Ketu,
Venus  etc.  Dasa  lengths  are  the  same  as  before,  but  the  part  of  Saturn  dasa  left  at
birth is 19 x 0.32125 = 6.10375 years. Then Mercury dasa is for 17 years, Ketu dasa
is for 7 years and so on.

In  the  same  example,  the  5th  star  from  Moon’s  star  is  Revathi  owned  by  Mercury.
Using the 5th star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa sequence as — Mercury,
Ketu,  Venus,  Sun  etc.  Mercury  dasa  left  at  birth  is  17  x  0.32125  =  5.46125  years.
Then Ketu dasa is for 7 years, Venus dasa is for 20 years and so on.

In the same example, the 8th star from Moon’s star is Krittika owned by Sun. Using
the 8th star to start Vimsottari dasa, we get the dasa sequence as — Sun, Moon, Mars,
Rahu etc. Sun dasa left at birth is 6 x 0.32125 = 1.9275 years. Then Moon dasa is for
10 years, Mars dasa is for 7 years and so on.

16.4.2  Dasa from Lagna

Some  authorities  have  also  recommended  Vimsottari  dasa  from  the  longitude  of
lagna  instead  of  Moon.  In  practice,  this  will  give  better  results  only  when  lagna  is
considerably more powerful than Moon.

16.5  Using Vimsottari Dasa
16.5.1  General Principles

  214

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Vimsottari dasa is a very general phalita dasa that can also be used as an ayur dasa.
All kinds of general results can be seen from it. A planet gives the results promised
by its positions in various divisional charts. Here are just a few examples:

(1) Period of the 5th lord in D-7 can give a child.
(2) Period of the 8th lord in rasi chart can give some troubles and frustration.
(3) Period of a planet exalted in GL in D-10 can give power and authority in career.
(4) Period of an exalted planet in the 12th from AK in D-9 can give serious thoughts

related to spiritual liberation.

(5) Period of the 7th lord in D-9 can give marriage.
(6) Period of a planet with Rahu in the 9th in D-4 can give foreign residence.
(7) Period of an exalted planet aspecting HL from the 11th from AL in rasi chart can

give a lot of wealth.

(8) Period of a planet joined by Moon and Saturn in the 8th house in D-30 may give

serious psychological problems and suicidal tendencies.

(9) Period of a well-disposed planet aspecting A3 in D-10 may make one write some

books.

These  are  just  a  few  examples.  One  should  look  at  various  divisional  charts  and
figure  out  the  results  indicated  by  different  planets.  Each  planet  gives  the  results
indicated by it in its dasas and antardasas. When analyzing antardasas, we can take
the dasa lord as a temporary lagna and analyze the charts.

16.5.2  Using Dasa Variations

If  the  sign  containing  the  5th  star  from  Moon  is  stronger  than  the  sign  containing
Moon,  Vimsottari  dasa  started  from  utpanna  star  may  be  preferred  for  general
results. If the 5th star spans across 2 signs, take the sign containing the same quarter
as  occupied  by  Moon  in  birthstar.  If  Moon  is  in  Makha  3rd  pada  (quarter),  for
example, 5th star is Chitra and it starts in Virgo and ends in Libra. So we should take
the  3rd  quarter  of  Chitra  and  we  then  get  Libra.  So  Leo’s  strength  should  be
compared to Libra’s.

How  do  we  know  which  sign  is  stronger?  There  are  no  clear  guidelines  in  the
literature to compare the strengths. A sign aspected by Jupiter and occupied by more
planets may be taken to be stronger. We can also use known events to see which dasa
is working better.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

215

Vimsottari dasa started from the 4th and 8th stars is used mainly for the purposes of
longevity  determination.  Look  at  the  signs  containing  Moon  and  these  2  stars  and
find  the  strongest  sign.  Here  a  sign  aspected  by  marakas  and  malefics  becomes
stronger. Start Vimsottari dasa from the star in the strongest of these 3 signs and use
it  in  longevity  analysis.  If  Moon  is  in  Makha  3rd  pada  in  Leo,  4th  and  8th  stars  are
Hasta  (Virgo)  and  Anuradha  (Scorpio).  We  should  compare  the  strengths  of  Leo,
Virgo and Scorpio.

16.5.3  Rath’s “Tripod of Life” Principle

Sun, Moon and lagna form the “tripod of life”. Parasara clearly said that we should
analyze all charts with respect to the positions of Sun, Moon and lagna. He advised
drawing  Sudarsana  chakra  with  the  innermost  chakra  representing  the  houses  with
respect  to  lagna  (body),  next  chakra  representing  the  houses  with  respect  to  Moon
(mind) and the outermost chakra representing the houses with respect to Sun (soul).

The  results  experienced  due  to  soul  (Sun)  last  long  and  change  slowly.  The  results
experienced  due  to  mind  (Moon)  last  shorter  and  change  fast.  The  results
experienced due to body (lagna) change even faster.

Sun  is  an  important  reference  point  in  rasi  and  divisional  charts  when  judging  the
results of a mahadasa. Moon is an important reference point when judging the results
of an antardasa. Lagna is an important reference point when judging the results of a
pratyantardasa.

If  a  planet  takes  part  in  a  Ravi  yoga  (solar  combination),  it  gives  the  results  of  the
yoga in its mahadasa. If a planet takes part in a Chandra Yoga (lunar combination), it
gives  the  results  of  the  yoga  in  its  antardasas.  If  a  planet  takes  part  in  other  yogas
(e.g. a Raja Yoga), it gives the results of the yoga primarily in its pratyantardasas.

In addition, dasa lord can be taken as a reference point when interpreting antardasas.

16.6  Practical Examples
16.6.1  As A Phalita Dasa

  216

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 52: Consider the dasamsa chart of Pandit Sanjay Rath, a Vedic astrology
author  and  founder  of  Sri  Jagannath  Vedic  Centre  (see  Chart  17).  Dasamsa  shows
one’s achievements in society.

Chart 17

Just a few days of Rahu dasa were left at birth. Mercury dasa has been running since
1998. During Mercury dasa, he published a brilliant book “Crux of Vedic Astrology
–  Timing  of  Events”  and  he  is  writing  more  books.  Why  did  Mercury  give  book
writing?

Dasamsa  shows  achievements  in  society  and  A3  (arudha  pada  of  3rd  house)  shows
the books authored by one. A3 is in Vi here. It has argalas from the 11th from it by
Venus and Jupiter and that shows saattwik and brilliant traditional knowledge as the
catalyst bringing gains in his book-writing. Mercury is the significator of writing and
communication and he has argala on A3 from the 4th from it. This shows that good
communication  skills  and  scholarship  (Mercury)  are  the  basic  driving  factor  in  his
book-writing.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

217

In  addition  to  containing  A3,  Virgo  is  the  3rd  from  GL.  GL  stands  for  power,
authority  and  fame.  The  3rd  house  from  GL  stands  for  fame  as  a  communicator.
Mercury owns and aspects it. In rasi chart, Mercury gives Vesi yoga being in the 2nd
from Sun. So his dasa should bring the results of Vesi yoga.

Chart 18

For  all  these  reasons,  Mercury  dasa  can  bring  him  book-writing  activities  and  the
fame that goes with it. He will author many more excellent books.

Example  53:  Let  us  consider  the  D-7  chart  of  a  lady  who  had  her  first  child  in
November 1994 and second child in December 1996 (see Chart 18).

Moon is in Sun’s constellation. First dasa belongs to Sun. About 1 year and 3 months
of Sun dasa was over before birth and the remainder of Sun dasa at birth was about 4
years  and  9  months.  Rahu  dasa  started  at  the  end  of  1993.  This  dasa  gave  her
children. Let us explain why Rahu gave children.

  218

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

D-7  chart  shows  progeny.  The  5th  house  shows  children  and  it  is  in  Aq  here.  It  is
owned by Saturn and Rahu. If one of the owners occupies the sign, the other owner
acts as the main owner, according to Parasara. Saturn is in Aq. So Rahu acts as the
5th  lord  in  this  chart.  He  is  in  the  11th  house  of  gains,  with  lagna  lord  Venus.  His
conjunction with Venus – conjunction of 1st and 5th lords – consists of a raja yoga in
the house of gains. For these reasons, Rahu can give the happiness of getting a child.
Antardasas  at  the  time  of  childbirth  belonged  to  Rahu  and  Jupiter.  Jupiter  is  the
naisargika and chara puttra karaka and he is in the 5th house here.

Rahu is the primary 5th lord here. But, after all, Saturn also owns 5th and moreover he
occupies  5th  with  Jupiter.  He  is  the  strongest  planet  in  5th.  Hence  pratyantardasa  at
the  time  of  both  the  childbirths  belonged  to  Saturn.  Pratyantardasa  running  at  the
time of an event usually belongs to the most important planet influencing the house
of interest in the divisional chart of interest.

Example 54: Let us consider the rasi chart of Sri Navin Patnaik (see Chart 19). He
was elected as the Chief Minister of India’s Orissa state in early 2000.

First  dasa  is  of  Mars  and  Mercury  dasa  started  in  July  1999.  Mercury  antardasa  in
Mercury mahadasa was running when he became Orissa’s CM.

Mercury  is  in  Libra.  Rajya  saham  and  GL  are  also  in  Libra.  So  Mercury  has  the
potential to bring kingdom.

From AL, Mercury is in the 6th house. Upachayas from AL bring gains in status and
a planet in the 6th from AL can bring an improvement in status.

Let  us  apply  Rath’s  “tripod  of  life”  principle.  Sun  is  in  Vi.  We  should  judge
mahadasa from Sun. Where is Mercury w.r.t. Sun? Mercury is Sun’s dispositor and
he is in the 2nd from Sun. This results in a powerful Vesi yoga.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

219

Chart 19

Even taking Moon as the reference, Mercury is 1st lord and he is in a trine. So he is
favorably  placed  from  Moon  also.  For  this  reason,  Mercury’s  antardasa  is  a  good
antardasa and there was success in the very first AD of Mercury MD.

Of  course,  Mercury  is  a  functional  benefic  in  dasamsa,  aspects  GL  and  occupies
rajya pada (A10) in a quadrant from lagna. These factors also contributed to success
in Mercury dasa.

Example 55: Let us consider the rasi chart of an engineer who came from India to
USA (see Chart 20). He studied at a reputed institution in India and had a good job at
a big company in USA. He had a wife and two children.

  220

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 20

He had a cruel shock when his wife filed a lawsuit against him in a US court at the
end  of  1995,  accusing  him  of  many  wrong  things  that  he  hadn’t  done.  She  had  his
bank  accounts  frozen  and  had  him  evicted  from  his  house.  He  was  then  running
Jupiter-Moon  antardasa  (i.e.  Jupiter  dasa,  Moon  antardasa)  as  per  Vimsottari  dasa.
This author predicted to him that things would just be fine and he would win the suit
in Mars antardasa. However, he could not go through with it, surrendered everything
to his wife, left his excellent job, left his house and kids to his wife and mother-in-
law and went back to India in mid-1996. He returned to USA in 1998 to start fresh
and  started  searching  for  a  job.  This  author’s  prediction  went  wrong  because  he
blindly used Vimsottari dasa started from Moon’s star.

Why did Jupiter-Moon antardasa bring such a catastrophe? Why was his life turned
upside down? Jupiter is an exalted functional benefic in a trine. Moon is an exalted
functional  benefic  in  a  quadrant.  Of  course,  we  can  give  vague  reasons  to  justify
almost anything, but that’s not the right approach. If we use the right variation of the
dasa, we don’t have to bend backwards or beat around the bush to explain events.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

221

Let us consider utpanna star. Moon is in Rohini. The 5th star Pushyami is in Cancer
and exalted Jupiter occupies it. Occupied by an exalted planet and owned by another
exalted planet, Cancer is very strong. It is a tough call in this case, but dasas started
from Pushyami explain the events better than dasas started from Rohini.

First  dasa  belongs  to  Saturn.  Venus  dasa  of  20  years  runs  from  February  1987  to
October 2006. Venus is lagna lord and he gives Vesi yoga being in the 2nd from Sun.
So his dasa is good. However, being the 8th lord from AL, he can also give a fall in
status.

Rahu’s antardasa runs during 1994-1997. As per Rath’s “tripod of life” principle, we
should give importance to Rahu’s position from Moon. Rahu is in the 8th house from
Moon  and  his  antardasa  is  unfavorable.  It  can  bring  unexpected  troubles  and
frustration.  Debilitated  Rahu’s  rasi  aspect  on  AL  can  also  cast  a  shadow  on  one’s
image and affect one’s status.

Ketu’s  pratyantardasa  ran  during  December  1995-February  1996  when  a  lot  of  this
drama unfolded and he was evicted from house with his accounts frozen. That shook
him up. We should give importance to lagna when judging pratyantardasas. Ketu is
lagna lord in the 8th house. Again it is a bad period.

Sun’s pratyantardasa was running when he went back to India, leaving everything he
had  behind  –  including  his  job  at  a  big  company.  Sun  is  the  10th  lord  and  he  is
debilitated in the 12th house, afflicted by Saturn and 8th lord. Moreover Sun is in the
8th  house  from  AL  and  that  adds  to  the  indications  of  a  fall  in  status.  So  Sun’s
pratyantardasa can bring losses and fall in status. During this pratyantardasa, he gave
up everything he had and went back to India.

Jupiter is the 8th and 11th lord from Moon. He is in the 3rd from Moon. Jupiter in 3rd
gives  a  positive  spirit.  Jupiter  antardasa  can  inject  some  energy  into  his  nearly
destroyed  life.  He  came  back  to  US  in  Jupiter  antardasa.  Saturn  is  an  exalted
yogakaraka from Moon and his antardasa should bring gains again.

16.6.2  As An Ayur Dasa

We  have  so  far  seen  examples  of  Vimsottari  dasa  used  as  a  phalita  dasa.  We  will
now see its use as an ayur dasa.

  222

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 56: We will consider John F. Kennedy, Jr’s rasi chart (see Chart 21). He
passed away on the night of July 16, 1999.

Parasara mentioned that the 3rd and 8th houses are the houses of life and the 2nd and
7th houses are the houses of death. He said that the 2nd house is particularly a maraka
(killer) house. Lords and occupants of these houses can kill a native.

Chart 21

Here the 2nd house is Virgo. Its lord Mercury is in mrityu bhaga in the 3rd house. He
is  a  strong  maraka.  Saturn  is  the  7th  lord.  He  is  also  Maheswara,  being  the  8th  lord
from AK Mars. He joins Jupiter, who is Rudra. Saturn is also a strong maraka. Mr.
Kennedy was running Saturn-Mercury antardasa when he passed away.

Example 57: Let us consider the rasi chart of a lady who committed suicide on April
6, 1988 (see Chart 22).

Jupiter is the 7th lord here and he is exalted. He is a very strong maraka. Venus is 2nd
lord in 2nd and he can kill too.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

223

Moon is in the 1st quarter of Bharani constellation. The 4th constellation is Mrigasira.
Because the 1st quarter of Mrigasira is in Taurus, we should take Taurus as the sign
of  4th  star.  The  8th  star  is  Aasresha  in  Cancer.  Cancer  contains  7th  lord  Jupiter,  a
maraka. However, it is not aspected by 2nd lord. Taurus, on the other hand, has the
rasi aspect of both Jupiter and Venus. Aspect of marakas makes a sign stronger. So
start dasas from the 4th star.

Chart 22

First dasa belongs to Mars and Jupiter-Venus antardasa  was running at death. Both
the planets are marakas.

Example 58: Let us consider the rasi chart of great astrologer Dr. B.V. Raman (see
Chart 23). He passed away on 20th December 1998, leaving a void in the astrological
community.

As  per  Vimsottari  dasa  reckoned  from  Moon’s  star,  he  passed  away  in  Venus-Sun
antardasa.  Venus  is  a  maraka  being  in  the  7th  house,  but  he  is  not  a  very  strong

  224

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

maraka. Though Sun owns 7th, he is in 6th, i.e. in the 12th from 7th and the 11th from
8th. The likelihood of Sun killing the native is small.

Who  are  the  strongest  marakas  in  this  chart?  Certainly,  Mercury  is  the  strongest
maraka. He owns 8th and occupies 7th. Malefics in the 2nd house are strong marakas.
So Rahu in the 2nd is also a maraka. Mars is also a maraka, being the 3rd lord in 7th.

Chart 23

Let us consider the variations of Vimsottari dasa  based on 4th and 8th stars. The 4th
star is Pushyami in Cancer. The 8th star is Uttaraphalguni and its 1st quarter is in Leo.
Because  Leo  is  the  strongest  sign,  we  can  start  dasas  from  Sun  who  owns
Uttaraphalguni (8th star from Moon’s star).

Starting Vimsottari dasa from the 8th star, we can see that Mercury-Rahu antardasa
was  running  in  December  1998.  Killership  of  both  the  planets  has  already  been
addressed.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

225

16.7  Conclusion

In  this  chapter,  Vimsottari  dasa  and  its  variations  are  explained  and  their  use  is
demonstrated.  Use  of  Vimsottari  dasa  as  a  phalita  dasa  as  well  as  an  ayur  dasa  is
demonstrated. As this is the most common constellation-based dasa system, readers
should master its use through practical experience.

Though many people limit themselves to Vimsottari dasa started from the birthstar,
one is advised to use the variations mentioned in this chapter for the best results.

If  all  the  quadrants  from  the  stronger  of  lagna  and  Moon  are  occupied  by  planets,
“Kendradi  Graha  Dasa”  is  more  appropriate  than  Vimsottari  dasa.  Results  from
Vimsottari dasa may not be very good in such cases.

In  addition, it should be noted that the error in the start/end dates of dasas have an
error of approximately m.n/4 days, if there is an error of m minutes in birthtime and
the complete duration of the first dasa is n years.

For example, if the first dasa belongs to Venus, then n = 20. So an error of 5 minutes
in the birthtime results in an error of 5x20/4 = 25 days in dasas (this is approximate).
Considering  this,  we  cannot  use  low  level  sub-periods  of  Vimsottari  dasa  (like
sookshma dasas) confidently, unless we rectify the birthtime.

It  is  a  good  idea  to  allow  a  margin  of  error  when  we  examine  the  dates  on  which
dasas start and end.

17.  Ashtottari Dasa

17.1  Introduction

Ashtottari  dasa  is  perhaps  the  most  popular  dasa  system  in  India  after  Vimsottari
dasa. Sage Parasara listed it as a conditional dasa applicable only in some charts. The
conditions for its applicability are highly controversial.

In this system, the sum of all dasas is 108 years. Ashtottari means “ashtottara sata”,
i.e.  one  hundred  and  eight.  Because  poornaayush  (full  life)  of  a  man  is  108  years,
some scholars have suggested that ashtottari dasa is best used as an ayur dasa, i.e. a
dasa that shows longevity.

Some  other  scholars  suggest  that  Ashtottari  dasa  can  be  used  as  a  phalita  dasa.
Because  only  chara  karakas,  i.e.  Rahu  and  the  seven  planets,  have  dasas  under  the
Ashtottari  dasa  scheme,  it  may  also  be  suggested  that  it  shows  events  related  to
sustenance, achievements, raja yogas and moksha (just like chara karakas do). Some
people, however, prefer to see all matters in Ashtottari dasa.

17.2  Computation

17.2.1  Dasas

Order of dasas and the length of dasas is as shown in Table 39. Each planet covers an
arc of either 53°20' (4 nakshatras) or 40°0' (3 nakshatras) in the zodiac, as shown in
that table.

We  note  natal  Moon’s longitude  and  see  which  of  the  eight  arcs  it  belongs  to.  The
planet ruling the arc will rule the first dasa. The fraction of the arc that is yet to be
traversed by natal Moon is calculated and the same fraction of the dasa length of the
first  dasa  lord  is  left  at birth.  After  that,  dasas  will  come  in the  order  shown  in  the
table and the length of a planet’s dasa is the full dasa length given in the table. After
Venus, we come back to Sun at the beginning of the table.

Example 59: Suppose Moon is at 24° in Leo. That is equivalent to 24°0' + 120°0'  =
144°0'. We see that 144° is between 120°0' and 160°0'. So it is in the 2nd arc of Table
39, which is ruled by Moon. The full dasa length is 15 years. Here we have to find
the fraction of the arc that is yet to be traversed. The arc starts at 120°0' and ends at
160°0'. So the part of the arc that is yet to be traversed by Moon is (160°0' – 144°0')

  228

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

= 16°. As a fraction of the arc length (40°), this is 16°/40° = 0.4. The same fraction
of the full dasa length of Moon is 15 x 0.4 = 6 years. The native will run Moon dasa
of  6  years  from  his  birth.  Then  8  years  of  Mars  dasa  will  run.  Then  17  years  of
Mercury dasa will run. Then 10 years of Saturn dasa will run. And so on.

NOTE: One has to be careful with the calculation if the first dasa is Rahu dasa. The
arc ruled by Rahu starts at 333°20' and ends at 26°40'. The ending longitude 26°40' is
equivalent to 386°40'  and we should use either 26°40' or 386°40' based on Moon’s
longitude. For example, if Moon is at 10º in Aries, then the part of the arc that is yet
to be traversed is 26°40' – 10° = 16°40'. If Moon is at 20º in Pisces, i.e. at 350º, then
the part of the arc that is yet to be traversed is 386°40' – 350° = 36°40'.

17.2.2  Antardasas

The first antardasa belongs to the planet that comes in the table after the dasa lord.
Then antardasas go in the same order as dasas and the last antardasa belongs to dasa
lord. For example, antardasas in Jupiter dasa go as: Rahu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars,
Mercury, Saturn and Jupiter. Antardasas in Moon dasa go as: Mars, Mercury, Saturn,
Jupiter, Rahu, Venus, Sun and Moon.

The length of a dasa is divided into eight antardasas in the ratio of the dasa lengths.
For example, Sun dasa is of 6 years. Moon antardasa in Sun dasa is of 6 x 15/108 =
0.8333 year = 10 months. Mars antardasa in Sun dasa is of 6 x 8/108 = 0.4444 year =
5 months 10 days. Mercury antardasa in Sun dasa is of 6 x 17/108 = 0.9444 years =
11 months 10 days. And so on.

17.2.3  Application

There are three different views on the applicability of Ashtottari dasa:

(1) Ashtottari dasa is applicable in all charts.
(2) Ashtottari  dasa  is  applicable  if  Rahu,  who  is  not  in  lagna,  is  in  a  quadrant  or  a

trine from lagna lord.

(3) Ashtottari  dasa  is  applicable  for  daytime  births  in  Krishna  paksha  (darker

fortnight) and night time births in Sukla paksha (brighter fortnight).

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

229

Some people use Ashtottari dasa as an ayur dasa and see longevity in it. Some other
people  use  Ashtottari  dasa  as  a  phalita  dasa.  Because  only  chara  karakas,  i.e.  Rahu
and the seven planets, have dasas under the  Ashtottari dasa scheme, it may  also be
suggested  that  it  shows  events  related  to  sustenance,  achievements,  raja  yogas  and
moksha (just like chara karakas do). Some people, however, prefer to see all matters
in Ashtottari dasa.

17.3  Examples

Example 60: We saw the chart of great astrologer Dr. B.V. Raman in Example 58.
We  noted  that  his  sad  demise  on  20th  December  1998  makes  better  sense  with
Vimsottari  dasa  started  from  the  8th  nakshatra  from  Moon’s  nakshatra  than
Vimsottari dasa started from Moon’s nakshatra. As per the former, he passed away in
Mercury-Rahu antardasa. Mercury is the 8th lord in the 7th house of death and Rahu is
a malefic in the 2nd house of death.

One  may  compute  Ashtottari  dasa  for  the  birthdata  given  in  Chart  23  and  find  that
Rahu-Mercury  antardasa  was  running  at  the  time  of  his  death.  For  reasons  already
explained, Rahu and Mercury are the strongest marakas in this chart. It is significant
that the same planets gave death in both dasas.

Example 61:  Let us consider the  assassination of  Indira Gandhi. Her birthdata and
assassination  data  are  given  in  Example  110  (in  a  later  chapter).  Her  rasi  chart  is
given in Chart 61.

One may calculate Ashtottari dasa for her  and find that Moon dasa ran from 1980-
1995. Saturn antardasa was running at the time of her assassination.

Saturn is the 7th lord in lagna and Moon is in the 7th house. They are the only planets
strongly associated with the 7th house of death. They can give death.

Example 62: Let us consider Sri P.V. Narasimha Rao’s rasi chart given in Chart 6.
He held important ministerial berths in Indian government during 1980-1989 and he
was India’s Prime Minister during 1991-1996.

  230

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

If  one  calculates  his  Ashtottari  dasa,  one  will  find  that  Mercury  dasa  ran  during
1981-1997. Mercury is lagna lord and he occupies an own sign. He is in the the 7th
house  from  AL  and  GL  and  certainly  promises  power.  The  planet  bringing  a  link
between  lagna  and  GL  by  way  of  aspect,  ownership  and  occupancy  brings  power.
Mercury  is  lagna  lord  and  he  has  a  rasi  aspect  on  both  lagna  and  GL.  He  can  give
power.

Moreover,  Sri  Rao’s  chart  has  a  powerful  Vipareeta  Raja  yoga  (VRY)  between  3rd
and  8th  lord  Mars  and  12th  lord  Sun,  who  are  within  a  17'  from  each  other.  If  the
planets involved in VRY have a conjunction or rasi aspect with lagna lord, then VRY
can give permanent results and the power is transferred to lagna lord. Here Mercury
is the dispositor of Mars and Sun and joins them in his own rasi. He has 7 rekhas in
BAV and his rasi Gemini has 34 rekhas in SAV. Mercury is in Uttamamsa. For all
these reasons, Mercury is a great yoga karaka. So his dasa (1981-1997) was excellent
from Sri Rao.

17.4  Conclusion

Ashtottari  dasa  is  a  popular  dasa,  but  its  applicability  as  well  as  application  are
controversial.  Readers  should  keep  this  in  mind  and  keep  their  minds  open  to
alternative  views.  What  is  taught  in  this  book  is  not  the  final  truth.  Of  course,  this
applies  to  everything  taught  in  this  book,  but  it  is  especially  applicable  to  this
chapter.

18.  Narayana Dasa

18.1  Introduction

Narayana  dasa  is  a  very  important  rasi  dasa.  It  is  a  phalita  dasa.  It  shows  general
results. Narayana dasa is computed differently for different divisional charts and we
can  use  Narayana  dasa  of  a  divisional  chart  to  predict  matters  related  to  that
divisional chart.

Narayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one’s life. As one dasa ends
and  another  starts,  one  rasi  stops  being  the  progressed  lagna  and  another  rasi
becomes  one’s  progressed  lagna.  Using  the  progressed  lagna  as  the  reference,  we
find  out  the  events  that  happen  in  that  dasa.  Thus  we  get  twelve  charts  for  each
person, with each chart applicable in one dasa.

This is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention to the details of
calculation.

18.2  Computation

18.2.1  Dasa Progression

Dasas  start  from  lagna  or  the  7th  house,  whichever  is  stronger.  We  use  the  rules  of
strength explained in the chapter “Strength of Planets and Rasis”. Let us denote the
stronger of lagna and 7th house by the expression “dasa seed”.

Movable  signs  are  governed  by  Brahma.  Fixed  signs  are  governed  by  Shiva.  Dual
signs are govenred by Vishnu.54 Brahma is associated with the regular movement of
1st,  2nd,  3rd  etc.  Vishnu  is  associated  with  the  trinal  movement,  i.e.  1st,  5th,  9th,  then
10th,  2nd,  6th  and  so  on.  We  cover  the  trines  from  dasa  seed  first,  go  to  another

54 Brahma is the God of creation. Vishnu is the God of sustenance. Shiva is the God of destruction.
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are together known as “Trimurthis” (the “Trinity of Gods”).

  232

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

quadrant and cover its trines and so on. Shiva, on the other hand, is associated with
the 6th movment. We take dasa seed, 6th from there, 6th from there and so on.

The direction of reckoning these houses is based on the 9th house from dasa seed. If
the 9th house from dasa seed is an odd-footed sign (Ar, Ta, Ge and Li, Sc, Sg), the
direction is forward. If the 9th house from dasa seed is an even-footed sign (Cn, Le,
Vi and Cp, Aq, Pi), the direction is backward.

Example 63: Suppose someone has lagna in Ta. Suppose Sc is stronger than Ta. Let
us find the dasa progression.

Because the 7th house is stronger than lagna, it becomes the dasa seed. So the dasa
seed  is  Sc.  Because  it  is  a  fixed  sign,  we  use  “every  6th”  progression  governed  by
Shiva. The 9th house from Sc is Cn. It is an even-footed sign. So the overall direction
is  backward.  So  we  should  count  houses  in  the  backward  direction.  The  6th  house
from Sc, counted backwards, is Ge. The 6th therefrom is Cp. We count the 6th house
from every rasi in the backward direction and get the complete dasa sequence as:

Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li, Ta, Sg, Cn, Aq, Vi and Ar

This is the order of dasas for the native.

Example 64: Suppose someone has lagna in Pi. Suppose Pi is stronger than Vi. Let
us find the dasa progression.

Because lagna is stronger than the 7th house, it becomes the dasa seed. So the dasa
seed  is  Pi.  Because  it  is  a  dual  sign,  we  use  the  trinal  progression  governed  by
Vishnu. The 9th house from Pi is Sc. It is an odd-footed sign. So the overall direction
is forward. So we should count houses in the forward direction. We count the 1st, 5th,
9th houses from dasa seed, then count the same houses from the 10th house, then from
the 7th house and finally from the 4th house. Trines from Pi are Pi, Cn and Sc. Trines
from the 10th (Sg) are Sg, Ar and Le. We get the complete dasa sequence as:

Pi, Cn, Sc, Sg, Ar, Le, Vi, Cp, Ta, Ge, Li and Aq.

This is the order of dasas for the native.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

233

Example  65:  Suppose  someone  has  lagna  in  Cn.  Suppose  Cp  is  stronger  than  Cn.
Let us find the dasa progression.

Because the 7th house is stronger than lagna, it becomes the dasa seed. So the dasa
seed is Cp. Because it is a movable sign, we use the regular (1st, 2nd, 3rd) progression
governed by Brahma. The 9th house from Cp is Vi. It is an even-footed sign. So the
overall direction is backward. So we should count houses in the backward direction.
We count the 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc houses from dasa seed backwards. We get the complete
dasa sequence as:

Cp, Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Pi and Aq.

This is the order of dasas for the native.

Saturn exception:

If Saturn occupies dasa seed, dasa progression becomes regular and zodiacal. If Sc is
dasa  seed  and  it  contains  Saturn,  dasa  progression  becomes  Sc,  Sg,  Cp,  Aq,  Pi,  Ar
etc.  If  Pi  is  dasa  seed  and  it  contains  Saturn,  dasa  progression  becomes  Pi,  Ar,  Ta,
Ge,  Cn,  Le  etc.  We  basically  make  the  direction  “forward”  and  use  Brahma’s
progression.

Ketu exception:

If Ketu occupies dasa seed, the basic direction of dasa progression becomes reversed.
If  it  is  normally  forward,  it  becomes  backward.  If  it  is  normally  backward,  it
becomes forward. If Sc is dasa seed and it contains Ketu, dasa progression becomes
Sc, Ar, Vi, Aq, Cn, Sg etc (comparing this with Example 63, readers may note that
the 6th house is counted in the forward direction instead of the backward direction).
If Pi is dasa seed and it contains Ketu, dasa progression becomes Pi, Sc, Cn, Ge, Aq,
Li  etc  (comparing  this  with  Example  64,  readers  may  note  that  the  5th,  9th,  10th  etc
house etc are counted in the backward  direction instead of the forward direction.).

Dasa  progressions  for  various  dasa  seeds  are  given  in  Table  40.  Three  cases  are
covered for each dasa seed — (a) the normal case, (b) with Saturn exception, and, (c)
with Ketu exception.

We  should  choose  the  dasa  progression  based  on  dasa  seed.  If  neither  Saturn  nor
Ketu occupies dasa seed, we should use the normal progression.  If Saturn occupies
dasa  seed,  we  should  apply  the  Saturn  exception.  If  Ketu  occupies  dasa  seed,  we
should apply the Ketu exception.

18.2.2  Dasa Length

The  length  of  a  dasa  is  determined  by  the  position  of  the  lord  of  dasa  rasi  with
respect  to  dasa  rasi.  Counting  is  forward  if  dasa  rasi  is  odd-footed.  Counting  is
backward if dasa rasi is even-footed. Count houses from dasa rasi to its lord. Subtract
one from the count. That gives dasa length in years.

Exceptions:

(1) If the count of houses from dasa rasi to its lord is one, i.e. dasa rasi contains its
lord,  then  we  get  zero  by  subtracting  one  from  one.  However,  dasa  length
becomes 12 years then.

(2) If the lord of dasa rasi is exalted, add one year to dasa length.

(3) If the lord of dasa rasi is debilitated, subtract one year from dasa length.

Special Notes:

(1) If dasa rasi is Aq or Sc, it has two lords. We should take the stronger lord when

computing Narayana dasa.

(2) After dasas of all the rasis are over, the second cycle starts. In the second cycle,
dasa  lengths  of  various  rasis  are  obtained  by  subtracting  the  dasa  length  in  the
first cycle from 12 years.

Example  66:  Let  us  take  the  rasi  chart  in  Chart  23  and  compute  Narayana  dasa.
Because the 7th house (Le) is stronger than lagna (Aq), dasa seed is Le. Because it is
a fixed sign, we use the “every 6th” progression governed by Shiva. Because the 9th
from  Le  (Ar)  is  odd-footed,  we  count  in  the  forward  direction.  Neither  Saturn  nor

  236

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Ketu occupies  Le and the exceptions don’t apply. Dasa sequence is — Le, Cp, Ge,
Sc, Ar, Vi, Aq, Cn, Sg, Ta, Li, Pi. Let us now find the lengths of various dasas.

Le  is  an  even-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Le  to  its  lord  Sun  in  the
backward  direction.  Sun  is  in  Cn,  i.e.  the  2nd  house  from  Le  in  the  backward
direction. So dasa length is 2–1=1  year. The native was born in August 1912. This
dasa runs from Aug 1912 to Aug 1913.

Cp  is  an  even-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Cp  to  its  lord  Saturn  in  the
backward  direction.  Saturn  is  in  Ta,  i.e.  the  9th  house  from  Cp  in  the  backward
direction. So dasa length is 9–1=8 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1913 to Aug 1921.

Ge  is  an  odd-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Ge  to  its  lord  Mercury  in  the
forward  direction.  Mercury  is  in  Le,  i.e.  the  3rd  house  from  Ge  in  the  forward
direction. So dasa length is 3–1=2 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1921 to Aug 1923.

Sc is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Sc to its lord Mars in the forward
direction. Mars is in Le, i.e. the 10th house from Sc in the forward direction. So dasa
length is 10–1=9 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1923 to Aug 1932.

Ar is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Ar to its lord Mars in the forward
direction. Mars is in Le, i.e. the 5th house from Ar in the forward direction. So dasa
length is 5–1=4 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1932 to Aug 1936.

Vi  is  an  even-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Vi  to  its  lord  Mercury  in  the
backward  direction.  Mercury  is  in  Le,  i.e.  the  2nd  house  from  Vi  in  the  backward
direction. So dasa length is 2–1=1 year. This dasa runs from Aug 1936 to Aug 1937.

Aq  is  an  even-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Aq  to  its  lord  Saturn  in  the
backward  direction.  Saturn  is  in  Ta,  i.e.  the  10th  house  from  Aq  in  the  backward
direction.  So  dasa  length  is  10–1=9  years.  This  dasa  runs  from  Aug  1937  to  Aug
1946.

Cn  is  an  even-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Cn  to  its  lord  Moon  in  the
backward  direction.  Moon  is  in  Ta,  i.e.  the  3rd  house  from  Cn  in  the  backward
direction. So dasa length is 3–1=2 years. However, Moon is exalted and we add one
year. We get 2+1=3 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1946 to Aug 1949.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

237

Sg  is  an  odd-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Sg  to  its  lord  Jupiter  in  the
forward  direction.  Jupiter  is  in  Sc,  i.e.  the  12th  house  from  Sg  in  the  forward
direction.  So  dasa  length  is  12–1=11  years.  This  dasa  runs  from  Aug  1949  to  Aug
1960.

Ta  is  an  odd-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Ta  to  its  lord  Venus  in  the
forward direction. Venus is in Le, i.e. the 4th house from Ta in the forward direction.
So dasa length is 4–1=3 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1960 to Aug 1963.

Li is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Li to its lord Venus in the forward
direction. Venus is in Le, i.e. the 11th house from Li in the forward direction. So dasa
length is 11–1=10 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1963 to Aug 1973.

Pi  is  an  even-footed  sign.  So  we  count  houses  from  Pi  to  its  lord  Jupiter  in  the
backward  direction.  Jupiter  is  in  Sc,  i.e.  the  5th  house  from  Pi  in  the  backward
direction. So dasa length is 5–1=4 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1973 to Aug 1977.

Thus the first cycle of dasas ends in Aug 1977. The second cycle starts then. Dasas
will come in the same order as in the first cycle. Let us compute the second cycle.

Because Le dasa is of 1 year in the 1st cycle, it is 12–1=11 years in the 2nd cycle. This
dasa runs from Aug 1977 to Aug 1988.

Because Cp dasa is of 8 years in the 1st cycle, it is 12–8=4 years in the 2nd cycle. This
dasa runs from Aug 1988 to Aug 1992.

Because Ge dasa is of 2  years in the 1st cycle, it is 12–2=10  years in the 2nd cycle.
This dasa runs from Aug 1992 to Aug 2002.

Exercise  27:  Calculate  Narayana  dasa  for  the  rasi  chart  given  in  Chart  21.  (Hints:
Saturn is the stronger lord of Aq and Ketu is the stronger lord of Sc. Aq is stronger
than Le.)

18.3  Antardasas

  238

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Each dasa is divided into 12 antardasas. All the antardasas have an equal length. If a
dasa is of n years, then each antardasa in that dasa is for n months.

Antardasas start from the rasi containing the lord of dasa rasi or the rasi containing
the lord of the 7th house from dasa rasi. Let us denote the stronger of dasa rasi and
the  7th  from  it  with  the  expression  “antardasa  seed”.  Antardasas  start  from  the  rasi
containing the lord of antardasa seed and we take the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc houses from
there. The direction of counting houses is forward or backward based on whether the
rasi  from  which  antardasas  start  is  an  odd  rasi  or  even  rasi.  (NOTE:  We  are  talking
about odd and even signs here and not about odd-footed and even-footed signs).

Example 67: Suppose Cp dasa of 5 years is running. Lords of Cp and Cn are Saturn
and Moon respectively. Suppose Saturn is in Le and Moon is in Ta. Antardasas start
from  either  Le  or  Ta.  If  Cp  is  stronger  than  Cn  (or  Saturn  is  much  stronger  than
Moon), then we start from Le. If Cn is stronger than Cp (or Moon is much stronger
than Saturn), then we start from Ta. Let us say Cn is stronger than Cp and Saturn is
not much stronger than Moon. Then antardasas start from Ta, which contains Moon.
Because Ta is an even sign, counting is backward. So antardasas go as — Ta, Ar, Pi,
Aq, Cp, Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn and Ge. Each antardasa is of 5 months.

Exceptions:  If  Saturn  occupies  antardasa  seed  rasi,  antardasas  go  in  the  forward
direction. If Ketu occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasa direction is reversed (from
forward to backward or from backward to forward). In the above example, antardasa
sequence becomes Ta, Ge, Cn,  Le,  Vi,  Li, Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq and Pi, if Ketu occupies
Cn.

18.4  Interpretation

Narayana dasa gives the progression of lagna in life. During the dasa of a rasi, that
rasi acts as lagna. If dasas are started from the 7th house from lagna, then Narayana
dasa  gives  the  progression  of  the  7th  house.  So  the  7th  from  dasa  rasi  gives  the
progressed lagna, i.e. the rasi that acts as lagna during the dasa.

Treat the dasa rasi or the 7th from it – based on whether dasas start from lagna or the
7th house – as lagna and analyze the chart, to see fortune in a dasa. We will denote it
with  “dasa  lagna”.  We  will  denote  the  rasi  containing  the  lord  of  dasa  lagna  with
“paaka rasi”.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

239

Just  as  the  strength  of  lagna  lord  is  very  important  in  a  natal  chart,  strength  of  the
lord  of  dasa  lagna  is  the  key  to  interpreting  a  dasa.  In  addition,  a  lot  of  principles
were mentioned by Parasara:

Natural malefics in the 3rd and 6th from dasa lagna give success in ventures. Natural
benefics  in  those  houses  give  failures.  Natural  benefics  in  trines  and  8th  from  dasa
lagna  give  happiness  and  success.  Natural  malefics  in  those  houses  give  failures,
obstructions  and  unhappiness.  Situation  of  a  planet  –  benefic  or  a  malefic  –  in  the
11th  house  ensures  gains.  Rahu  in  the  8th  and  12th  houses  from  dasa  lagna  gives
constant fear. If the lord of dasa lagna or the lord of a trine or a quadrant from it is
exalted or in own house, it gives excellent results. Debilitation, on the other hand, is
bad. If the lord of a dusthana from dasa lagna is debilitated, it gives good results. If
the  4th  house  from  dasa  lagna  has  malefics,  there  will  be  discomfort  and  lack  of
happiness.  Benefics  in  the  same  house  give  happiness,  well-being  and  pleasures.
Benefics in the 2nd and 5th houses from dasa lagna give good name, fame and favors
from authorities. Malefics in the same houses bring bad results in the same areas. If
the  7th  house  from  dasa  lagna  and  paaka  rasi  is  afflicted  by  malefics,  there  may
troubles  in  marriage.  Raja  yogas  and  dhana  yogas  with  respect  to  dasa  lagna  bring
success. If dasa lagna or paaka rasi is associated with an exalted planet or a planet in
own house, there will be all-round success and accumulation of wealth in that dasa.

In  addition  to  interpreting  dasas  taking  dasa  lagna  as  lagna,  we  can  interpret  dasas
from  the  natal  references  also.  For  example,  dasa  of  raajya  pada  gives  success  in
career. Dasa of upapada may bring marriage. Dasa of the 2nd house or the 7th house
from  upapada  may  bring  troubles  in  marriage.  Dasa  of  GL  may  bring  power.  In
particular,  antardasas  aspected  by  GL  may  bring  promotions.  Antardasas  aspecting
upapada may bring marriage. Arudha padas aspected by antardasa rasi are important
in deciding the results in an antardasa.

We  also  judge  the  results  given  in  antardasas  by  looking  at  the  house  occupied  by
antardasa lord from dasa rasi.

Another approach is to divide each dasa into three equal parts. The rasi dominates in
the first part. Its lord dominates in the second part and gives his results. Occupants of
the rasi and those who aspect it dominate in the third part.

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 68: Let us consider the rasi chart of Bill Gates, the well-known billionaire
of computer software giant Microsoft Corporation (see Chart 24). Lagna is stronger
than the 7th house as its exalted lord aspects it. So dasas start from Ge.

Chart 24

Narayana dasa calculations are given below:

Ge (04 years):  Oct 1955 - Oct 1959
Aq (05 years):  Oct 1959 - Oct 1964
Li (12 years):  Oct 1964 - Oct 1976
Vi (12 years):  Oct 1976 - Oct 1988
Ta (05 years):  Oct 1988 - Oct 1993
Cp (04 years):  Oct 1993 - Oct 1997
Sg (08 years):  Oct 1997 - Oct 2005

During  Cp  dasa,  Mr.  Gates  had  a  phenomenal  rise  in  stature  and  finances.  His
company  Microsoft  became  the  powerhouse  of  computer  software.  Why  was  Cp
dasa such a good dasa?

(1) Cp contains raajya pada (A10 – arudha pada of the 10th house).

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

241

(2) During  Cp  dasa,  dasa  lagna  is  Cp  and  paaka  rasi  is  Li.  Lord  of  dasa  lagna  is
Saturn. He is exalted in the 10th house with the 10th lord Venus (from dasa lagna).
They form a powerful raja yoga w.r.t. dasa lagna as well as paaka rasi.

(3) Exalted  Mercury  is  in  a  trine  from  dasa  lagna  and  Jupiter  is  in  8th  from  dasa
lagna. Rahu is in 11th. Two powerful planets are in 10th. All these are favorable
placements.

(4) Sun owns the 8th house from dasa lagna and he is debilitated.

At the time of writing this book, Mr. Gates is going through Sg dasa. How will Sg
dasa be?

(1) Dasa lagna is Sg and paaka rasi is Le. The lord of dasa lagna is not particularly
strong (not as strong as the previous dasa’s dasa lagna lord). But he is not weak
either. So things can slow down.

(2) Dasa  lagna  lord  Jupiter  occupies  the  9th  house  suggesting  some  noble  acts  of

charity.

(3) Rahu occupies the 12th house. This shows constant fear. (Microsoft Corporation
is facing law suits from the federal government and several state governments in
US, for being a monopoly).

(4) Sun, the lord of the 9th house from dasa lagna, is debilitated. He is also the lord of

paaka rasi. This can suggest some loss of fortune.

(5) However, other planets are favorably placed w.r.t. dasa lagna. The 10th and 11th
houses from dasa lagna are particularly strong. Exalted Mercury occupies the 10th
house  from  dasa  lagna  and  he  has  a  raaja  yoga  with  Mars  w.r.t.  dasa  lagna.  So
Mr. Gates may continue to be a successful and innovative enterpreneur.

Example 69: Let us consider the rasi chart of India’s independence chart and look at
the 1990’s (see Chart 25). Narayana dasa calculations are given below:

Ta (02 years):  Aug 1947 - Aug 1949
Sg (10 years):  Aug 1949 - Aug 1959
Cn (12 years):  Aug 1959 - Aug 1971
Aq (07 years):  Aug 1971 - Aug 1978
Vi (02 years):  Aug 1978 - Aug 1980
Ar (02 years):  Aug 1980 - Aug 1982
Sc (07 years):  Aug 1982 - Aug 1989
Ge (01 years):  Aug 1989 - Aug 1990
Cp (06 years):  Aug 1990 - Aug 1996

  242

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Le (01 years):  Aug 1996 - Aug 1997
Pi (05 years):  Aug 1997 - Aug 2002

Chart 25

Capricorn  dasa  runs  during  1990-1996.  Mars  in  the  6th  house,  Jupiter  in  the  10th
house and Ketu in the 11th house from dasa lagna are well-placed. Conglomeration of
planets in the 7th house (relations with other nations) and Ketu in the 11th house gives
gains  from  foreign  sources.  From  paaka  rasi  also,  Rahu  is  in  the  11th  house  and  it
shows the same thing. So Indian economy was liberalized. Jupiter in the 10th house
shows a versatile, intelligent and knowledgable Brahmin leader (Sri P.V. Narasimha
Rao). Aspect of Mars on the analytical and tamasik rasi Vi containing the 9th house
from dasa lagna made the judiciary system relatively aggressive. This resulted in the
probe into hawala55 scam that shook national politics.

While  there  was  progress  during  1990-1996  due  to  the  good  placement  of  most
planets w.r.t. dasa lagna, India experienced disorder, confusion and instability during
1996-1997.  During  this  time,  India  had  a  minority  government  formed  by  a

55 Hawala means “bribes for favors”

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

243

conglomeration  of  minor  parties  that  formed  a  “third  force”  in  Indian  politics.
During this period, India ran Le dasa.

Dasa lagna during Le dasa is Le itself. Except Mars, no planet is well-placed w.r.t.
Le. In particular, planetary conglomeration in the 12th house shows constant fear and
turbulence. It signals instability. Rahu in the 10th house from dasa lagna denies stable
and capable leadership.

During 1997-2002, India runs Pisces dasa. Most planets are well-placed w.r.t. Pisces.
So Pisces dasa is a better dasa. As Pisces is a conservative rasi, conservative thought
may be predominant in the nation. Jupiter owns the 10th house and Mars aspects it.
So  India  has  another  learned  and  intelligent  Brahmin  leader  who  has  Martian
strength in his horoscope (Sri A.B. Vajpayee).

Chart 26

Ketu  in  the  9th  house  from  dasa  lagna  may  denote  religious  clashes  and  violence.
Mars  in  the  4th  house  may  denote  lack  of  comfort  and  the  absence  of  a  feeling  of
well-being. These two are bad placements that stand out. Rahu in the 3rd house from
dasa  lagna  makes  India  very  bold  and  assertive.  Rahu  in  the  3rd  can  also  give

  244

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

aggressive  weapon  development,  as  the  3rd  house  shows  weapons.  India  conducted
nuclear tests in May 1998. Antardasas in Pisces dasa start from Libra and proceed in
the forward direction. Antardasa at the time of nuclear tests was Sc. Sc aspects A3,
which  is  in  Ar.  A3  shows  the  illusion  related  to  boldness  or  the  things  based  on
which  the  world  forms  impression  about  one’s  boldness,  i.e.  one’s  weapons.
Antardasas  aspecting  A3  can  bring  weapons,  just  as  antardasas  aspecting  UL  can
bring marriage.

Exercise 28: The native of Chart 26 had an excellent career in India until 1997. Then
he had to go to US with his wife, who is a software engineer. He could not find the
right job for his qualifications in US. He could not succeed in his efforts to redeem
his  career.  He  had  to  depend  on  his  wife  and  went  through  a  lot  of  hard  times.
Calculate Narayana dasa and explain the events.

18.5  Narayana Dasa of Vargas

Narayana dasa may be calculated for vargas (divisional charts) also. Narayana dasa
of a varga throws light on the progress of matters shown in that varga. For example,
we can use Naryana dasa of D-4 to time changes in residence, happiness from home
and stay in foreign countries. We can use Narayana dasa of D-10 to time events in
career.  We  can  use  Narayana  dasa  of  D-24  to  time  events  related  to  learning  and
knowledge. We can use Narayana dasa of D-9 to time marriage and to predict events
in marital life. We can use Narayana dasa of D-7 to predict happiness from children.
We can use Narayana dasa of D-12 to predict relations with parents.

Narayana  dasa  of  vargas  is  computed  a  little  differently.  Each  divisional  chart  is
based on a seed house. The seed for D-n is the nth house. For example, the seed of D-
9  is  the  9th  house.  D-9  shows  dharma  (duty).  To  get  married,  to  live  with  one’s
spouse and to perform religious ceremonies with spouse are one’s duties or dharma.
This is why Navamsa is also called Dharmamsa. The seed of D-10 is the 10th house.
That is why D-10 shows one’s karma or action in society. The seed of D-7 is the 7th
house. Sex is for procreation and begetting progeny. The seed of D-4 (house) and D-
16 (vehicles and pleasures) is the 4th house. D-12 in the physical plane (it shows the
lineage one belongs to) and D-24 in the mental plane (it shows one’s learning) show
the evolution of one’s self in the respective planes. They are both based on the 12th
house as the seed, which shows the evolution of self.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

245

To get the seed of D-n, just take the nth house. For example, the seed of D-11 is the
11th house. If n is greater than 12, subtract multiples of 12 from n. For example, the
seed of D-16 is 16–12=4th house. The seed of D-27 is 27–24=3rd house. The seed of
D-30 is 30–24=6th house. The seed of D-24 is 24–12=12th house. The seed of D-40 is
40–36=4th house.

Procedure:

(1) Find the seed house of the divisional chart of interest.
(2) Take that house in rasi chart.
(3) Find its lord. Take the stronger lord in the case of Aq and Sc.
(4) Take the rasi occupied by him in the divisional chart of interest as lagna and find
Narayana dasa of the divisional chart just as if it were a rasi chart. Use the rules
explained in the previous sections.

Warning on Interpretation: Narayana dasa of vargas is not the progression of lagna
or the 7th house. So taking dasa rasi or the 7th from it as lagna and analyzing dasas is
has no technical basis. It applies only the rasi chart.

Example  70:  Suppose  someone’s  rasi  chart  has  lagna  in  Cn.  Suppose  we  want
Narayana dasa of D-10 to time some events in career. The 10th house is the seed of
D-10. The 10th house in rasi chart is Ar. Its lord is Mars. Suppose D-10 has lagna in
Ta and Mars in Vi. We ignore lagna in D-10 and treat the rasi containing Mars in D-
10 as lagna and use the rules of Narayana dasa of rasi chart. So we treat Vi as lagna.
We take the stronger of Vi and Pi as the dasa seed. Suppose Vi is stronger and it does
not contain Saturn or Ketu. Then dasas go as Vi, Cp, Ta, Ge, Li, Aq etc. We find the
lengths  of  dasas  and  antardasas  taking  D-10  and  applying  the  rules  taught  for  rasi
chart.

Example 71: Let us time the foreign stay of the native of Chart 27 using Narayana
dasa of D-4. Readers may recall that D-4 shows one’s residence and fortune. It is the
appropriate chart for timing foreign stay.

  246

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 27

Lagna  is  at  14  Vi  52.  The  4th  house  in  rasi  chart  is  Sg  and  Jupiter  owns  it.  He
occupies Cp in D-4. Let us treat Cp as lagna. So dasa seed is the stronger rasi of Cp
and Cn (which is the 7th from Cp). As 2 planets occupy Cp, it is stronger than Cn. So
dasas start from Cp. Narayana dasa calculations are given below:

Cp (04 years):  Apr 1970 - Apr 1974
Sg (00 years):  —
Sc (03 years):  Apr 1974 - Apr 1977
Li (09 years):  Apr 1977 - Apr 1986
Vi (05 years):  Apr 1986 - Apr 1991
Le (11 years):  Apr 1991 - Apr 2002

NOTES:

(1) Saturn is in the 4th house from Cp, reckoned in the backward direction because
Cp  is  an  even-footed  rasi.  We  get  4–1=3.  However,  Saturn  is  exalted  and  we
have to add one year. So Cp dasa is of 4 years.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

247

(2) Jupiter is in the 2nd house from Sg. We get 2–1=1. However, Jupiter is debilitated
and we have to subtract one year. So Sg dasa is of zero years. However, Sg dasa
of 12 years will come in the second cycle.

We can see that Le is the 9th house. The 9th house shows prospering in a foreign land.
Rahu signifies foreign things and he occupies Le. Exalted 12th lord Mars aspects Le.
For these reasons, Le dasa is a natural candidate for giving foreign stay. We can see
that 11-year Le dasa started in April 1991. The native moved from his motherland to
US on 15th August 1991 for higher studies. He is working as a software engineer in
US now.

Antardasa: To find antardasas in Le dasa, we should take the stronger of Le and Aq.
Both  have  one  planet  each.  Le  is  aspected  by  Mercury  and  Jupiter,  while  Aq  is
aspected by Mercury and its co-lord Saturn. Neither contains an exalted planet. Aq is
an odd sign and its stronger lord is also in an odd sign. On the other hand, Le is an
odd sign and its lord is in an even sign. So Le is stronger and antardasas start from
the rasi containing Sun – the lord of Le. So antardasas start from Vi. Because Vi is
an even sign, they go in the backward direction. Antardasas of 11 months go as Le,
Vi, Cn, Ge etc. The native went abroad in Vi antardasa containing Sun. Sun owns the
9th house in D-4 and owns the 12th house in rasi chart. Lord of Vi is Mercury and he
occupies the 9th house from dasa rasi.

Pratyantardasa: Vi is stronger than Pi, as it has a planet. Lord of Vi is Mercury. He
is in Ar – an odd rasi. So pratyantardasas in Vi antardasa go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le
etc. Vi antardasa is of 11 months and it runs from 4th April 1991 to 4th March 1992.
Dividing it into 12 equal parts, we see that the 5th pratyantardasa runs from 27th July
1991 to 25th August 1991. So Le pratyantardasa was running when the native landed
in US. Le is the 9th house containing Rahu.

Example 72: Let us consider the navamsa chart of a lady who got married in mid-
1993 (see Chart 28).

Lagna in rasi chart is Li. The seed for navamsa (D-9) is the 9th house. The 9th lord in
rasi chart is Mercury. He is in Ge in navamsa and Ge is stronger than Sg. So dasas
start from Ge. Narayana dasa calculations are given below:

Ge (12 years):  Sep 1971 - Sep 1983
Aq (08 years):  Sep 1983 - Sep 1991

  248

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Li (02 years):  Sep 1991 - Sep 1993

Chart 28

When  she  got  married  in  August  1993,  she  was  running  Li’s  Navamsa  Narayana
dasa. Why did Li’s dasa give marriage?

Lagna in navamsa shows self, from the point of view of dharma and marital life. So
lagna’s  dasa  is  favorable  for  marriage.  Dasas  of  the  1st,  3rd  and  8th  houses  from
upapada (UL) are also favorable for marriage. On the other hand, dasas of 6th house
from lagna, dasas of the 2nd and 7th houses from UL can bring troubles in marriage
and even a divorce when the chart has such indications. Because UL shows marriage,
the 1st, 3rd and 8th houses from it show its birth, vitality and life (longevity). The 2nd
and 7th houses from it show its end.

Here Li is lagna. So its dasa can certainly bring marriage.

Example 73: Let us consider the navamsa chart of another lady and guess when she
got married. See Chart 29.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

249

Lagna is at 4 Vi 08. So the 9th house in rasi chart is Ta. Lord is Venus. He is in Pi in
Navamsa. Vi is stronger than Pi, as its lord Mercury  aspects it. So dasas start from
Vi. Narayana dasa calculations are given below:

Vi (09 years):  Jul 1969 - Jul 1978
Cp (05 years):  Jul 1978 - Jul 1983
Ta (11 years):  Jul 1983 - Jul 1994
Ge (06 years):  Jul 1994 - Jul 2000

Chart 29

Dasas  of  lagna  and  UL  do  not  run  at  the  ages  when  marriage  is  likely.  Dasa  of
Taurus runs from the age of 14 years to 25 years. Taurus is the 3rd from UL and its
lord is exalted in UL. So Taurus dasa can give marriage. Which antardasa can give
marriage? Certainly, Aq with lagna and UL lord is a strong candidate and Pi with UL
and exalted Venus (significator of marriage) is an even stronger candidate.

As  Sc  is  aspected  by  co-lord  Ketu,  it  is  stronger  than  Ta.  However,  Mars  is  the
stronger lord of Sc, as he is aspected by Mercury and his dispositor (Mercury again).

  250

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Ketu  is  aspected  only  by  his  dispositor  (Saturn)  and  Mars’  count  of  2  beats  Ketu’s
count  of  1.  So  antardasas  start  from  Vi.  The  7th  antardasa  belongs  to  Pi.  Each
antardasa is of 11 months and the 7th antardasa starts after 5.5  years. It runs during
Jan-Dec 1989. The lady got married in May 1989. So Pi antardasa brought marriage.

Exercise 29: Consider the lady  whose Navamsa is given in Chart 30. Despite wise
counsel by elders, this lady insisted on leaving her husband and ended her marriage
in early June 2000. Find the antardasa running then as per Navamsa Narayana dasa
and explain the event.

Chart 30

Example  74:  Let  us  consider  the  D-10  of  an  electrical  engineer  who  faced  some
setbacks in career during 1994-1996 (see Chart 31). His enemies conspired and laid a
trap for him and he was suspended by the government from his job for a mistake he
did not make. He had to suffer for a long time.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

251

Lagna is at 16 Aq 50. The 10th house in rasi chart is Sc and Mars is its lord. Mars is
in  Cp  in  D-10.  Cn  is  stronger  than  Cp,  as  Jupiter  occupies  it  and  its  lord  Moon
aspects it. Narayana dasa starts from Cn and the calculations are given below:

Cn (03 years):  Sep 1947 - Sep 1950
Ge (11 years):  Sep 1950 - Sep 1961
Ta (11 years):  Sep 1961 - Sep 1972
Ar (10 years):  Sep 1972 - Sep 1982
Pi (09 years):  Sep 1982 - Sep 1991
Aq (05 years):  Sep 1991 - Sep 1996

Chart 31

The setbacks occurred in Aq dasa. Why is Aq a bad dasa?

Aq is the 8th house from lagna in D-10 and it gives tension, frustration, worries and
setbacks  (related  to  career).  It  is  the  12th  house  of  losses  from  AL,  showing  some
setbacks in professional status. The 2nd and 5th houses and also Sun show recognition
from authorities in a chart. Sun owns the 2nd house here and he is in Aq, afflicted by
enemy Rahu. Affliction of Sun by Rahu in dasa rasi can show scandals and making a
bad name with authorities. Aquarius has Satru pada (arudha pada of 6th house) and it

  252

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

can  show  trouble  from  enemies.  Because  of  the  exaltation  of  Saturn  in  a  quadrant,
the middle part of this dasa must be good. Because the occupants of a rasi dominate
the last one-third of a dasa, that was when Sun and Rahu gave the troubles.

Exercise  30:  Consider  the  gentleman  whose  D-10  is  given  in  Chart  32.  Find
Dasamsa Narayana dasa running in 1996-1998 and judge whether that period should
be good or bad for his career.

Chart 32

Example  75:  Let  us  consider  the  native  whose  D-16  is  given  in  Chart  33.  D-16
shows  vehicles,  comforts  and  discomforts.  The  native  had  a  vehicular  accident  in
December  1996.  Let  us  find  the  antardasa  running  then  and  see  if  the  event  makes
sense.

Lagna is at 14 Vi 52. The seed of D-16 is the 4th house, as 16–12=4. The 4th lord in
Rasi chart is Jupiter.  In  D-16, he is in Vi and Vi is stronger than Pi. So dasas start
from Vi. Narayana dasa calculations of D-16 are given below:

Vi (04 years):  Apr 1970 - Apr 1974
Cp (01 years):  Apr 1974 - Apr 1975

Ge (11 years):  Apr 1978 - Apr 1989
Li (10 years):  Apr 1989 - Apr 1999

Chart 33

In Li dasa, antardasas start from the lord of Li or Ar. Li is aspected by Mercury and
its lord Venus and it is stronger. Its lord Venus is in Le, an odd rasi. So antardasas
start from Le and go in the forward direction. Li dasa started in April 1989 and this
event happened in December 1996. From April 1989 to December 1996, a period of
7 years and 8 months (7x12+8=92 months) passed. Each antardasa is of 10 months as
Li dasa is of 10 years. So 9 antardasas finish after 90 months and the 10th antardasa
runs in the 92nd month. The 10th house from Le is Ta. Why did Ta antardasa bring an
accident?

Ta is the 12th from vahanapada (A4 – arudha pada of the 4th house). It can give losses
to the vehicle. Lord of A4 is Mercury and he is with Rahu and Ketu in Ta. So vehicle
can  be  involved  in  an  accident.  Moreover,  mrityu  pada  (A8)  is  in  Ta  and  troubles

  254

related to vehicles can be expected. Nobody was hurt in the accident, but the car was
badly damaged and the native was given a new car by his insurance company. In the
next 6 months, his new car was damaged twice while parked in a parking lot. One of
the damages was serious. So Ta antardasa continued to give vehicular troubles.

One may wonder why we are looking at antardasa and not mahadasa. Events shown
by  mahadasa  suggest  the  overall  mood  of  the  whole  10  year  period,  while  events
shown  by  antardasa  are  applicable  to  10  months  here.  With  Li  being  the  4th  house
and  having  the  argala  of  lord  Venus,  the  native  had  the  comfort  of  vehicles  in  Li
dasa.  However,  Ta  antardasa  was  bad  due  to  Rahu  and  A8.  Based  on  the  event  of
interest,  we  should  judiciously  choose  mahadasa  or  antardasa  or  pratyantardasa  for
examination. If an event plays a role in a native’s life for just a week, it is probably
shown in pratyantardasa. If an event plays a role in a native’s life for a few months, it
is probably shown in antardasa. Mahadasa shows the mood of longer periods. If we
want to analyze a temporary activity that remains in a native’s mind for just an hour,
it  is  probably  seen  in  the  praana-antardasa  or  deha-antardasa  running  then.  We
should  determine  the  effective  period  of  an  event  and  judiciously  choose  the  dasa
division in which it should be seen.

18.6  Sub-divisions of Narayana Dasa

Narayana dasa is a versatile rasi dasa. It is a general purpose phalita dasa. It can be
computed separately for each divisional chart for precise timing of events related to
the matters associated with that divisional chart. We can go down to the precision of
a  day  or  an  hour  by  using  fine  sub-divisions  of  dasas.  As  in  Example  71,  we  can
divide each antardasa into 12 equal pratyantardasas. This is done in the same manner
as each dasa is divided into 12 equal antardasas. In the same manner, we can divide
each pratyantardasa into 12 equal sookshma-antardasas (or simply sookshma dasas),
each  sookshma-antardasa  into  12  equal  praana-antardasas  (or  simply  praana  dasas)
and each praana-antardasa into 12 equal deha-antardasas.

When we say that a period is divided into 12 equal sub-periods, what do we mean by
“equal”? We obviously mean that the twelve sub-periods have the same length. The
next question is — how do we measure the length of a sub-period? In days, hours,
minutes  and  seconds?  No!  We  measure  the  length  of  a  period  (or  a  sub-period)  by
the angle of the arc traversed by Sun during that period (or sub-period). Two periods
are  said  to  be  equal  if  and  only  if  Sun  moves  by  the  same  degrees,  minutes  and

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

255

seconds  during  the  two  periods.  In  other  words,  we  take  1  year=12  months  and  1
month=30 days, where 1 day is the time in which Sun moves by 1º.

Motion  of  Sun  is  the  basis  for  measuring  time  in  rasi  dasas.  Suppose  a  dasa  of  5
years starts after the native completes 37 years. If Sun is at 23° 50' 25'' in Aq in the
birthchart of a native born in 1960, he finishes 37 years when Sun reaches the same
longitude  in  1997.  If  the  dasa  is  of  5  years,  each  antardasa  is  of  5  months.  This
corresponds  to  the  time  in  which  Sun  moves  by  5x30º=150º.  When  each  antardasa
divided into 12 equal pratyantardasas, Sun moves by exactly 150º/12=12°30' during
each pratyantardasa.

Thus we should divide time in the space of Sun’s longitude when dividing dasas upto
praana-antardasas or deha-antardasas. Then only  correct results will be obtained. A
free  software  program  for  computers  using  Microsoft  Windows  operating  systems
can be downloaded at http://www.VedicAstrologer.org. Given the birthdata and the
start year and length of a mahadasa, this software program can divide the mahadasa
upto the level of deha-antardasas using Sun’s longitude as the measure of time.

18.7  Conclusion

Narayana dasa may be said to be the most important phalita dasa. Its versatility lies
in  the  fact  that  it  can  be  computed  separately  for  each  divisional  chart  for  precise
timing of specific matters. In fact, we can compute more than one Narayana dasa for
each  divisional  chart.  Narayana  dasa  of  D-12  seeded  from  the  12th  lord  is  native-
centric.  It  shows  events  in  a  native’s  life  that  are  related  to  parents.  Even  when
looking at the events in the lives of parents, it takes the native as the reference. To
see events in the lives of parents directly, we can use different seeds. Similarly, 12th
house used as the seed in D-24 Narayana dasa shows the learning from the point of
view of one’s evolution. One can use the 4th house (formal learning) as the seed in
D-24  Narayana  dasa  to  see  formal  education.  By  using  a  different  seed,  we  can
examine  the  events  related  to  the  chosen  divisional  chart  from  a  different  angle.
Readers should try to master this fantastic dasa system.

18.8  Answers to Exercises

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Exercise 27:

The  7th  house  has  2  planets  and  lagna  has  only  one.  So  the  7th  house  acts  as  dasa
seed.  Progression  for  Aq  is:  every  6th.  Because  Li  (9th  from  Aq)  is  odd-footed,
direction is normally “forward”. But Ketu’s presence in Aq reverses it and makes it
“backward”. Saturn acts as the lord of Aq and Ketu as the lord of Sc. Dasas go as:

Aq (02 years):  Nov 1960 - Nov 1962
Vi (11 years):  Nov 1962 - Nov 1973
Ar (02 years):  Nov 1973 - Nov 1975
Sc (03 years):  Nov 1975 - Nov 1978
Ge (04 years):  Nov 1978 - Nov 1982
Cp (01 years):  Nov 1982 - Nov 1983
Le (09 years):  Nov 1983 - Nov 1992
Pi (03 years):  Nov 1992 - Nov 1995
Li (02 years):  Nov 1995 - Nov 1997
Ta (07 years):  Nov 1997 - Nov 2004
Sg (12 years):  Nov 2004 - Nov 2016
Cn (05 years):  Nov 2016 - Nov 2021

Aq (10 years):  Nov 2021 - Nov 2031
Vi (01 years):  Nov 2031 - Nov 2032
Ar (10 years):  Nov 2032 - Nov 2042
Sc (09 years):  Nov 2042 - Nov 2051
Ge (08 years):  Nov 2051 - Nov 2059
Cp (11 years):  Nov 2059 - Nov 2070
Le (03 years):  Nov 2070 - Nov 2073
Pi (09 years):  Nov 2073 - Nov 2082

We stop here because 120 years is the paramayush of human beings.

Exercise 28:

Both Ge and Sg are unoccupied. Neither is occupied or aspected by Jupiter, Mercury
or lord. Ge is an odd rasi and Mercury is also in an odd rasi. But Sg is an odd rasi
and Jupiter is in an even rasi. So Sg is stronger. Narayana dasa calculations are given
below:

Sg (11 years):  May 1971 - May 1982
Le (05 years):  May 1982 - May 1987
Ar (10 years):  May 1987 - May 1997
Pi (04 years):  May 1997 - May 2001

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

257

Sc (03 years):  May 2001 - May 2004

Because we started dasas from the 7th house instead of lagna, Narayana dasa shows
the progression of the 7th house instead of lagna. So dasa lagna is the 7th from dasa
rasi. During Ar dasa, dasa lagna is Li. Due to the exaltation of dasa lagna lord Venus
(among other things), it was a very good dasa. During Pi dasa, dasa lagna is Vi. Lord
of Vi is Mercury and he is in the 8th house from it. Lords of two dusthanas – Mars
and Sun – are exalted and that suggests hard times. Jupiter in the 3rd from dasa lagna
suggests  failures.  There  are  no  malefics  in  the  3rd  or  6th  from  dasa  lagna.  Saturn  in
the 9th house suggests loss of fortune or struggle for fortune in far away places. Ketu
in the 11th house shows gains from foreign sources. Exalted 9th lord Venus is in the
7th house. So he went abroad following his wife.

Exercise 29:

Lagna is at 0 Sc 39. Moon is the 9th lord in rasi chart. He is in Aq. Le is stronger than
Aq  because  Sun  is  more  advanced  in  his  rasi  than  Saturn.  Dasas  start  from  Le.
Because  of  the  presence  of  Saturn  in  Le,  they  go  in  the  regular  zodiacal  order.
Narayana dasa calculations are given below:

Le (02 years):  Jun 1976 - Jun 1978
Vi (08 years):  Jun 1978 - Jun 1986
Li (07 years):  Jun 1986 - Jun 1993
Sc (10 years):  Jun 1993 - Jun 2003

Let us find antardasas in Sc dasa. Ta is stronger than Sc. Lord of Ta is Venus. He is
in Ta itself. So antardasas start from Ta. Because Ta is an even rasi, antardasas go in
the backward order. Each antardasa lasts 10 months. It takes 80 months (or 6 years
and 8 months) for 8 antardasas to finish. So the 9th antardasa starts in February 2000
and  runs  for  8  months.  The  9th  antardasa  belongs  to  the  9th  house  from  Ta  in  the
backward direction. It is Vi.

Vi is the 2nd house from UL and it shows the end of marriage. Ketu occupies it and
Sun,  Mars  and  Rahu  aspect  it.  Because  of  these  malefic  influences,  Vi  periods  can
break her marriage. Sun’s aspect on the 2nd from UL can denote father’s influence in
the  break-up.  This  lady  encountered  resistance  from  mother  and  maternal  relatives,
but her father encouraged her to end the marriage.

Exercise 30:

Sg contains Mercury  who owns the 10th house in rasi chart. Sg is stronger than Ge
and dasas start from Sg. Dasamsa Narayana dasa calculations are given below:

Sg (11 years):  Jul 1961 - Jul 1972
Le (03 years):  Jul 1972 - Jul 1975
Ar (11 years):  Jul 1975 - Jul 1986
Pi (04 years):  Jul 1986 - Jul 1990
Sc (04 years):  Jul 1990 - Jul 1994
Cn (05 years):  Jul 1994 - Jul 1999

Cancer dasa was running in 1996-1998. Is it good or bad?

Cancer is the 5th house from lagna and it shows recognition. It contains AL in D-10
and  shows  status  in  career.  Cancer  has  argalas  and  rasi  aspects  from  lagna  lord
Jupiter and Sun. Moreover, it has bhaagya pada (A9 – arudha pada of the 9th house).
A9  shows  the  illusion  associated  with  fortune  (in  career,  because  this  is  D-10).  It
shows  the  things  based  on  which  people  form  impression  about  one’s  fortune.  It
essentially shows the trappings of fortune, like good position and money. Dasa of A9
in D-10 can give excellent position in career. So this period must have been excellent
for the native’s career.

In  fact,  it  was.  The  native  owned  a  private  company  specializing  in  computer
software  and  hardware  for  a  niche  market.  He  sold  his  company  to  a  large
corporation  for  several  millions  of  dollars  in  February  1997  and  became  a  Vice
President of that corporation. It was predicted to him by this author in mid-1996 that
a very important event in his professional and financial life would take place in the
middle of February 1997.

19.  Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa

19.1  Introduction

There is a dasa called “Kendradi Graha Dasa” or “Moola dasa”, which goes through
the  dasas  of  planets  in  quadrants,  panapharas  and  apoklimas  from  the  stronger  of
lagna  and  Moon  (some  authors  include  Sun).  Vimsottari  dasa  years  with
moolatrikona correction are used. According to some authors, this dasa is applicable
to  all  people.  In  particular,  if  there  are  4  planets  in  quadrants  from  the  stronger  of
lagna and Moon, this dasa gives much better results than Vimsottari dasa.

Moola dasa is beyond the scope of this book. But we will cover a similar dasa, which
belongs  to  rasis  instead  of  planets.  It  is  called  “Kendradi  Rasi  Dasa”.  In  particular,
we will cover “Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa”.

Kendra means “quadrants” and adi means “starting with”. In this dasa, we cover the
rasis in quadrants from lagna first and then cover panapharas and apoklimas.

This is a phalita dasa that shows material success well.

19.2  Computation

(1) Dasas  start  from  the  stronger  of  lagna  and  7th  house.  Let  us  call  this  rasi  “dasa

seed”.

(2) The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or backward based on whether lagna
is in an odd sign or an even sign. If Saturn is in the stronger of lagna and 7th, dasa
order is forward. If Ketu is in the stronger of lagna and 7th, dasa order is reversed.

NOTE:  We  are  talking  about  odd  and  even  signs  here  and  not  about  odd-footed
and even-footed signs.

(3) First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th) from dasa seed.
(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) from dasa seed.

  260

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(5) Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th) from dasa seed.

(6) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in Narayana

dasa.

Suppose  lagna  is  in  Ge  and  Ge  is  stronger  than  Sg.  Then  dasas  start  from  Ge.
Because Ge is an odd sign, we go in the forward order and get dasa order as:

Ge (1st), Vi (4th), Sg (7th) , Pi (10th), Cn (2nd), Li (5th), Cp (8th) , Ar (11th), Le (3rd), Sc
(6th), Aq (9th) , Ta(12th).

Suppose lagna is in Ta and Ta is stronger than Sc. Then dasas start from Ta. Because
Ta is an even sign, we go in the backward order and count houses in the backward
direction. We get dasa order as:

Ta (1st), Aq (4th), Sc (7th) , Le (10th), Ar (2nd), Cp (5th), Li (8th) , Cn (11th), Pi (3rd), Sg
(6th), Vi (9th) , Ge (12th).

19.3  Interpretation

Parasara  taught  that  the  quadrants  are  ruled  by  Sri  Maha  Vishnu  and  the  trines  are
ruled by Sri Maha Lakshmi. If we cover the trines of lagna, then go to the trines of
another  quadrant  and  cover  all  the  12  signs  in  that  fashion  (i.e.  as  the  trines  from
quadrants),  that  sequence  is  quadrant-based  and  hence  Narayana  rules  it.  This
progression is seen for dual signs in Narayana dasa. On the other hand, if we cover
the quadrants of lagna first, then go to the quadrants of 5th/9th and finally cover the
quadrants of the 3rd trine, then the sequence is trine-based and Sri Lakshmi rules it.

In other words, the sequence 1st, 5th, 9th, 10th etc is quadrant-based and it is ruled by
Narayana. The sequence 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th is trine-based and it is ruled by Lakshmi.

So Kendradi rasi dasa uses the movement ruled by Lakshmi. Lakshmi is the goddess
of wealth and prosperity. So this dasa shows the periods of prosperity. It shows the
progression of lagna using the movement ruled by Sri Lakshmi.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

261

NOTE: We will learn Sudasa in a later chapter. Sudasa is also a Kendradi Rasi Dasa,
but started from Sree Lagna instead of lagna. Sree Lagna is the Lakshmi sthana56 in a
horoscope.  So  its  progression  using  the  movement  ruled  by  Sri  Lakshmi  is  more
important.

Example 76: Let us consider the horoscope of former US President Ronald Reagan
(see Chart 34).

Chart 34

Lagna is in Sc. Ta is stronger than Sc, as it has Jupiter’s aspect. So dasas start from
Ta. Because Ta is an even rasi, we  go anti-zodiacally. Dasas  go as shown in Table
41.

Dasas  from  Ta  to  Pi  add  up  to  65  years  and  run  during  1911-1976.  Sg  dasa  runs
during 1976-1986. Mr. Reagan became US President in 1980. Why did Sg dasa bring
such success?

(1) Usually rasis containing AK give success. Sg has AK.
(2) Signs having a strong argala of AmK show coming under the decisive influence
of good advisors, ministers and bureaucrats. We find in the charts of politicians
that rasis having strong argalas from AmK give political power. That is because
political  power  usually  brings  a  leader  in  the  company  of  excellent  advisors,
ministers,  secretaries  or  bureaucrats.  Here  Sg  has  an  unobstructed  argala  from
AmK  Sun,  who  is  in  the  2nd  from  Sg  in  Gopuramsa  with  6  rekhas  in
ashtakavarga. This shows very capable political advisors.

(3) More than anything else, Sg has GL. GL is the seat of power in a chart.
(4) Lagna lord Mars is in Sg and he connects lagna to GL.

19.4  Conclusion

This  dasa  shows  material  success  as  it  is  based  on  a  movement  ruled  by  Sri  Maha
Lakshmi.  It  may  be  used  in  conjunction  with  Sudasa  to  predict  material  success.
However, Sudasa is a superior dasa.

A  noted  author  who  wrote  a  book  on  “Mandooka  dasa”  made  some  changes  to
“Lagna  Kendradi  Rasi  Dasa”  and  presented  it  as  “Mandooka  dasa”.  However  the
quadrants-panapharas-apoklimas  movement  is  called  “kendraadi  gati”  and  certainly
not  mandooki  gati.  Mandooki  gati  was  clearly  explained  by  Parasara  in  his
discussion on Kalachakra dasa and it is the 3rd/11th jump. Mandooka dasa is based on
mandooki gati and Mandooka dasa of Rudramsa is used for predicting the results of
wars  and  death.  The  dasa  presented  by  the  gentleman  in  question  is  certainly  not
Mandooka dasa. It is only a variation of the dasa discussed in this chapter.

20.  Sudasa

20.1  Introduction

Sudasa  is  a  rasi  dasa.  It  is  also  called  “Sree  Lagna  Kendradi  Rasi  Dasa”  or  simply
“Rasi  Dasa”.  Its  computation  is  based  on  kendras  etc  from  Sree  Lagna.  Sudasa  is
important for materialistic things like money, power and authority. It can be used to
predict financial matters and matters related to status and power. If a political leader
occupies a post of power, he must be enjoying a favorable dasa as per Sudasa.  If a
businessman  sees  increasing  profits,  he  must  be  enjoying  a  favorable  dasa  as  per
Sudasa.  If  someone  struggles  with  tight  finances,  he  must  be  going  through  an
unfavorable dasa as per Sudasa.

20.2  Computation

(1) In  Sudasa,  dasas  start  from  the  sign  containing  Sree  Lagna  (see  the  chapter  on

special lagnas).

(2) The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or backward based on whether SL is

in an odd sign or an even sign.

NOTE:  We  are  talking  about  odd  and  even  signs  here  and  not  about  odd-footed
and even-footed signs.

(3) First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th) from SL.
(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) from SL.
(5) Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th) from SL.

(6) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in Narayana

dasa.

(7) But there is an exception in the case of first dasa. Only a fraction of first dasa is
left at birth. This fraction is found using the formula: (30° – SL’s advancement in
its sign)/30°.

  264

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example  77:  Consider  Sri  Vajpayee’s  rasi  chart  shown  in  Chart  3.  His  SL  is  at
12°21' in Capricorn.

(1) Dasas start from Capricorn, the sign containing SL.

(2) Because Capricorn is an even sign, the direction of reckoning dasas is backward.

(3) First 4 dasas will belong to kendras from Cp, reckoned in the backward direction.

They are Cp, Li, Cn and Ar.

(4) Next  4  dasas  will  belong  to  panapharas  from  Cp,  reckoned  in  the  backward

direction. They are Sg, Vi, Ge and Pi.

(5) Last  4  dasas  will  belong  to  apoklimas  from  Cp,  reckoned  in  the  backward

direction. They are Sc, Le, Ta and Aq.

(6) Dasa periods are found as in Narayana dasa. We get dasa periods as:

Cp:
Li:
Cn:
Ar:
Sg:
Vi:
Ge:
Pi:
Sc:
Le:
Ta:
Aq:

2 years
2 years
11 years
12 years
2 years
10 years
5 years
1 year
2 years
8 years
7 years
3 years

(7) SL is at 12°21' in Capricorn. The fraction of the first dasa left at birth = (30° –

12°21'/30° = (1800 – 741)/1800 = 0.5883.

First  dasa  of  Cp  is  of  2  years  and  0.5883  of  it  is  1.1766  years,  i.e.,  1  year  2
months 3 days 14 hours. So this is the remainder of Cp dasa at birth. After this,
Li dasa of 2 years will start.

20.3  Interpretation

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

265

(1) Dasas of HL, 7th from HL and the signs aspecting HL bring financial prosperity.

If the lord of the dasa sign occupies or aspects HL, it will improve the chance of
financial prosperity. Similarly, if the lord of HL occupies or aspects dasa sign, it
will also improve the chances of financial prosperity.

For example, say HL is in Aries, Mars is in Leo and Sun is in Scorpio. Then (a)
Leo aspects HL, (b) lord of Leo aspects HL and (c) lord of HL occupies Leo. So
Leo dasa is triply likely to bring financial prosperity.

(2) Same  thing  holds  for  GL  and  the  prescribed  results  are  power  and  authority

instead of financial prosperity.

(3) Upachayas  from  any  house  stand  for  the  growth  of  matters  signified  by  that
house. AL stands for one’s status. So dasas of upachayas from AL bring growth
of status. Dasa of the 11th house from AL is particularly favorable.

(4) The 8th and 12th houses from AL bring setbacks to one’s status. Their dasas can

be unfavorable.

Example 78: Consider Sri Vajpayee, whose Sudasa was calculated in Example 77.
His GL is in Cancer. Capricorn is the 7th house from GL and it can bring power and
authority. Its lord Saturn aspects GL. Moon is the lord of GL and he aspects Cp. So
Cp dasa is very favorable for attaining a position of power and authority. Moreover,
Cp  contains  AL  and  A5.  AL  shows  status  and  A5  can  show  power.  The  5th  house
shows  one’s  following.  A5  shows  things  based  on  which  the  world  forms  an
impression  about  one’s  following.  It  can  show  the  trappings  of  power.  Capricorn
dasa in the second cycle made him the Prime Minister of India.

Of course, Narayana is important for power, though Sri Lakshmi gives prosperity. So
we  should  always  check  Narayana  dasa  along  with  Sudasa.  Sri  Vajpayee  was
running the Narayana dasa of Sc during the same time and so he became the Prime
Minister. Scorpio is lagna and houses a powerful raja  yoga between AK  (Mercury)
and PK (Saturn). We studied in the chapter “Yogas” that the conjunction of AK and
PK is a raja yoga, especially in 1st and 5th.

Example  79:  Consider  Indian  political  leader  Jayalalita’s  chart  shown  in  Chart  35.
She was the Chief Minister of an important state in south India during 1991-1996.

Her SL is in 22 Sg 22. So dasas start from Sg. Because Sg is an odd sign, counting of
houses is in the zodiacal direction. Dasas  go  as Sg, Pi, Ge, Vi (quadrants); Cp, Ar,
Cn, Li (panapharas); Aq, Ta, Le, Sc (apoklimas). The first dasa of Sg is of 12 years,
because its lord Jupiter is in Sg. But SL is at 22°22' in Sg and the remainder in first
dasa at birth is 12 x (30° – 22°22')/30° = 12 x 0.2544 years =  3 years 19 days. After
that, 3 years of Pi dasa, 8 years of Ge dasa, 7 years of Vi dasa, 6 years of Cp dasa, 4
years  of  Ar  dasa,  11  years  of  Cn  dasa  and  6  years  of  Li  dasa  follow.  Li  dasa  ran
during Feb 1990-Feb 1996.

As  Libra  contains  AL,  GL  and  HL,  its  dasa  as  per  Sudasa  must  give  status,  power
and wealth. No wonder the native became a powerful Chief Minister.

21.  Drigdasa

21.1  Introduction

Drigdasa is a rasi dasa. Drik means vision and drigdasa is a dasa based on aspects. It
shows  how  spiritual  vision  develops  in  a  native  and  steers  one’s  life.  If  a  native’s
chart promises spiritual growth, this dasa shows religious and spiritual activities and
the evolution of one’s soul.

21.2  Computation

(1) Dasas start from the 9th house.

(2) First  4  dasas  belong  to  the  9th  house  and  the  3  signs  aspected  by  it.  Order  of
reckoning is forward or  backward based on whether the 9th house is odd-footed
or even-footed.

(3) Next 4 dasas belong to the next house (10th house) and the 3 signs aspected by it.
Order  of  reckoning  is  forward  or  backward  based  on  whether  the  10th  house  is
odd-footed or even-footed.

(4) Last 4 dasas belong to the house after that (11th house) and the 3 signs aspected
by it. Order of reckoning is forward or backward based on whether the 11th house
is odd-footed or even-footed.

(5) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in Narayana

dasa.

Example 80: Consider the gentleman in Chart 36. His lagna is in Libra. Ge is the 9th
house, Cn is the 10th house and Le is the 11th house.

(1) Dasas start from the 9th house, i.e., Ge.

(2) Because Ge is an odd-footed sign, we should go forward as Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li etc

and find the signs that aspect Ge. We get Ge, Vi, Sg and Pi.

  268

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(3) Next 4 dasas will belong to the 10th house (Cn) and rasis aspected by it. Because
Cn is an even-footed sign, we should go backward as Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Pi etc and
find the signs that aspect Cn. We get Cn, Ta, Aq and Sc.

(4) Last 4 dasas will belong to the 11th house (Le) and rasis aspected by it. Because
Le is an even-footed sign, we should go backward as Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar etc and
find the signs that aspect Le. We get Le, Ar, Cp and Li.

(5) So dasas go as Ge, Vi, Sg, Pi, Cn, Ta, Aq, Sc, Le, Ar, Cp and Li. Dasa periods of

individual signs are found just as in Narayana dasa.

21.3  Interpretation

(1)  Dasa  of  arudha  lagna  can  bring  renunciation  if  there  are  parivraja  yogas  in  the

chart, indicating renunciation.

(2)  Dasas  of  signs  aspecting  arudha  lagna  can  bring  external  activities  that  are

important for one’s spiritual evolution.

(3)  Dasa  of  lagna  and  the  7th  house  can  bring  internal  awakening  and  self-

realization.

(4)  Dasa  of  lagna  can  also  bring  fame  and  power  related  to  spreading  spiritual
knowledge. A monk may, for example, become the Chief Pontiff of a monastery.
(5)  Dasas  of  signs  containing  or  aspecting  mantrapada  (A5,  arudha  pada  of  the  5th
house) can bring a religious initiation or sadhana (rigorous practice) of a mantra.
(6)  Dasa of the sign containing mrityupada (A8, arudha pada of 8th house) can bring

yogic sadhana. It can activate Kundalini sakti.

(7)  Ketu is the significator of moksha (final liberation). Dasa of the sign containing
Ketu  can  bring  spiritual  activities  that  take  one  towards  liberation.  Ketu  is  the
only planet who can give real spiritual awakening and liberation.

(8)  Dasa  of  the  sign  containing  Rahu  can  create  progress  after  internal  turmoil  if
Rahu is favorable. If Rahu is unfavorable, it can take the native in the direction
of materialism.

Example 81: Consider the gentleman in Chart 36, whose Drigdasa was computed in
Example  80.  Let  us  analyze  Ta  dasa  that  comes  during  24-27  years  of  age.  Ta  has
mokshakaraka  Ketu  in  it.  Lagna  and  mantrapada  are  in  Li  and  Ta  aspects  both.
Because of these reasons, Ta dasa can bring internal progress and spiritual evolution.
It can make the native learn and use mantras.

Example  82:  Chart  37  gives  the  rasi  chart  of  an  ISKCON57  devotee  who  was
disillusioned  with  the  materialistic  world,  left  his  education  in  mathematics  at  a
Russian  university,  wandered  in  the  forests  for  a  few  months  and  then  found
ISKCON. He was introduced to ISKCON and moved to a monastery in 1990.

Chart 37

Lagna is in Aq. The 9th house is in Li. It is an odd-footed sign. So we start from Li,
go  zodiacally  and  list  the  rasis  aspecting  Li.  They  are  Li,  Aq,  Ta  and  Le.  The  10th
house is in Sc. It is an odd-footed sign. So we start from Sc, go zodiacally and list the
rasis aspecting Sc. They are Sc, Cp, Ar and Cn. The 11th house is in Sg. It is an odd-
footed sign. So we start from Sg, go zodiacally and list the rasis aspecting Sg. They
are Sg, Pi, Ge and Vi. So dasas go as

Li, Aq, Ta, Le, Sc, Cp, Ar, Cn, Sg, Pi, Ge, Vi

57  ISKCON  is  an  acronym  for  “International  Society  for  Krishna  CONsciousness”,  which  was
founded  by  Srila  Prabhupada  for  spreading  Krishna  consciousness  and  Vaishnava  thought  in  the
world.

Lengths of dasas are found as in Narayana dasa. Dasa sequence is given below:

Li:
Aq:
Ta:
Le:

1 year
9 years
6 years
7 years

Leo  dasa  runs  during  Jan  1987-Jan  1994.  Leo  is  the  7th  from  lagna  and  it  contains
Ketu. It can give spiritual awakening.

Chart 38

Example  83:  Chart  38  shows  the  rasi  chart  of  Sri  Aurobindo  Ghose.  He  was  an
Indian  political  activist,  freedom  fighter,  yogi,  spiritual  teacher  and  a  renowned
author who wrote excellent commentaries on Vedas, Upanishats etc.

After his education in England, he returned to  India to take part in India’s freedom
movement. He was imprisoned by the British in 1908. During his time in the prison,
he  went  through  a  spiritual  evolution.  He  realized  that  Indians  had  lost  their

  272

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

independence not only politically, but also culturally and religiously58. He dedicated
himself to spreading Indian culture and religion. When he was released in 1910, he
withdrew  from  active  politics  and  started  an  aashram  (monastery)  in  Pondicherry,
India. During 1906-1913, he was running Scorpio’s dasa as per Drigdasa. Scorpio is
the  7th  house  from  AL;  it  aspects  lagna;  and,  it  contains  its  lord  Ketu.  For  these
reasons, Scorpio dasa can bring internal awakening and take one close to liberation.
AL and the 7th from it can also play an important role in external activities such as
renunciation and moving to (or starting) a monastery.

However,  his  aashram  had  only  a  handful  of  followers  in  the  beginning.  As  his
magazine  and  books  were  read  by  more  people,  he  started  becoming  popular.  In
early  1920’s,  the  number  of  students  in  his  aashram  grew  manifold.  During  1918-
1925, he ran Cn dasa. As Cn contains lagna, its dasa brings true enlightenment and
also  recognition.  During  lagna’s  dasa,  a  monk  can  become  a  chief  of  a  monastery.
Here he got recognition and his aashram grew.

Libra’s  dasa  started  in  August  1925.  Sri  Aurobindo  left  the  material  and  spiritual
charge  of  his  aashram  to  the  Mother  and  retired  into  seclusion  to  pursue  yogic
sadhana.  Libra  contains  mrityupada  and  has  the  argala  of  Ketu.  No  wonder  he
wanted  yogic  sadhana  in  seclusion,  rather  than  spreading  religious  learning  in  the
world.

58 This is partly true even today. It is amazing to see how an average Indian intellectual undervalues
the achievements of Indian culture and the wisdom in the teachings of ancient maharshis.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

22.  Niryaana Shoola Dasa

22.1  Introduction

Niryaana  means  death  and  shoola  is  a  weapon  of  Lord  Shiva,  who  is  the  lord  of
destruction.  Niryaana  Shoola  dasa  is  one  of  the  most  reliable  dasa  systems  for  the
timing of death. Parasara simply called it “Shoola dasa”, but some scholars59 use the
name Shoola dasa to denote a different dasa. We will learn it in another chapter. In
order  to  avoid  confusion,  we  will  call  the  dasa  to  be  learnt  in  this  chapter  as
“Niryaana Shoola dasa”.

22.2  Computation and Interpretation

22.2.1  Computation

Find the stronger of the 2nd and 8th houses. Start from the rasi containing that house.
If the rasi is odd, go in the forward (zodiacal) direction and cover the 12 rasis. If the
rasi  is  even,  go  in  the  backward  (anti-zodiacal)  direction  and  cover  the  12  rasis.
Dasas of movable, fixed and dual rasis have 7, 8 and 9 years respectively.60

Classics  are  not  clear  about  how  we  go  about  finding  antardasas.  This  author
suggests using the same rules used for Narayana dasa.

22.2.2

Interpretation

Dasa of strong maraka rasis and dasas of rasis containing strong maraka grahas can
bring  death.  Usually  death  occurs  in  the  dasa  of  a  Trishoola  rasi.  There  are  three
Trishoola rasis and we can identify the correct rasi based on the longevity category
(short, middle or long life).

59 An example is  my  guru Pundit Sanjay  Rath, author of “Jaimini Maharishi’s Upadesa Sutras” and
“Crux of Vedic Astrology: Timing of Events”.
60 Sthira dasa, Mandooka dasa etc also use the same dasa years, though dasa sequences are different
under those dasa systems.

  274

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

If Trishoolas don’t bring death, the rasi containing Rudra in the 12th house can bring
death.

Antardasa at the time of death can be the 6th, 7th, 8th or 12th rasi from dasa rasi. It can
also  be  a  rasi  that  aspects  the  rasi  that,  in  navamsa,  contains  the  owner  of  the  8th
house  from  dasa  rasi.  Suppose  dasa  rasi  at  death  is  Ta  and  Jupiter  is  in  Le  in
navamsa. Then the antardasas of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 12th houses from Ta (i.e. Li, Sc,
Sg  and  Ar)  can  bring  death.  Also  the  antardasas  of  Ar,  Le,  Li  and  Cp  –  rasis  that
aspect Le, which contains Jupiter in navamsa – can bring death. If there is a common
rasi between these two principles, it can be a strong candidate.

Example 84: Let us consider the native of Chart 8. Rudra, Trishoola etc were found
for this native in Exercise 23. Let us calculate Niryaana Shoola dasa.

We have to find the stronger of 2nd (Sg) and 8th (Ge). Sg is stronger. It is an odd rasi.
So  dasas  start  from  Sg  and  go  as  Sg  (9  years),  Cp  (7  years),  Aq  (8  years),  Pi  (9
years), Ar (7 years), Ta (8 years), Ge (9 years) etc. It may be seen that Ge dasa starts
after 9+7+8+9+7+8 = 48 years. It runs till the age of 57 years. The native died at an
age of 50 years. So he died in Ge dasa. Why?

Well, we found in Exercise 23 that Ge, Li and Aq form Trishoola and the native has
middle life. Ge is the only Trishoola rasi whose dasa comes in the middle life range
(36-72 years).

Ge dasa ran during Dec 1994-Dec 2003. When he died in July 1997, the 4th antardasa
was running (each antardasa is of 9 months). Antardasas in Ge dasa start from Li and
go as Li, Sc, Sg, Cp etc. The 4th antardasa is Cp. It may be noted that Cp is the 8th
house from Ge and Cp aspects Le, which contains Saturns in navamsa. Saturn is the
8th lord from dasa rasi. So Ge-Cp antardasa (Ge dasa, Cp antardasa) brought death.

Example  85:  Let  us  consider  Rajiv  Gandhi’s  chart  (see  Chart  39).  He  was
assassinated in May 1991.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

275

Chart 39

The  2nd  house  is  stronger  than  the  8th  house,  as  it  is  occupied  by  a  planet  (Mars).
Dasas start from Vi. It is an even rasi and so dasas go backwards. We get Vi dasa of
9 years, Le dasa of 8 years, Cn dasa of 7 years, Ge dasa of 9 years, Ta dasa is of 8
years and Ar dasa of 7  years. Ar dasa ran during Aug 1985-Aug 1992. Mr. Gandhi
died in this dasa. Why?

Rudra  is  the  stronger  of  the  8th  lords  from  Le  and  Aq.  So  Rudra  is  the  stronger  of
Moon and Saturn (see Table 32). Moon is stronger and he becomes Rudra. He is in
Le. So Trishoola spikes are in Ar, Le and Sg. Being a Trishoola rasi, Ar can kill.

In Ar dasa, each antardasa is of 7 months. During May 1991, the 10th antardasa was
running. In Ar dasa, antardasas start from the lord of the stronger of Ar and Li. Li is
stronger as its lord Venus aspects it. So dasas start from Le, which contains Venus.
The 10th from Le is Ta. From Ar, the 8th lord is Ketu and he is in Cp with Mars in
navamsa. Ta aspects Cp.

  276

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 86: Let us consider India Gandhi’s rasi chart given in Chart 61 (in a later
chapter). She was assassinated on October 31, 1984.

Because Saturn is in Cn, we take the 8th houses from Cn and Cp in the normal way,
instead  of  using  Table  32.  The  8th  lord  Rahu  is  debilitated  and  he  joins  another
planet. The 2nd lord Sun also joins another planet. But debilitated 8th lord is a better
candidate for being Rudra. So Trishoola is in the trines from Sg, i.e. Ar, Le and Sg.

Because the 2nd house with a planet is stronger than the empty 8th house, dasas start
from the 2nd house. As Le is an odd rasi, dasas go zodiacally. Dasas go as Le, Vi, Sc,
Sg  etc.  It  may  be  verified  that  Ar  dasa  runs  during  Nov  1982-Nov  1989.  Ar  is  a
Trishoola rasi.

Let us find antardasas in Ar dasa. Ar is stronger than Li, as its lord Mars aspects it.
Antardasas start from Mars in Le and go as Le, Vi, Le, Sc etc. Each antardasa is of 7
months  as  Ar  dasa  is  of  7  years.  Nov  1982-June  1983  is  the  first  antardasa  of  Le.
June  1983-Jan  1984  is  the  second  antardasaof  Vi.  Jan  1984-Aug  1984  is  the  third
antardasa of Li. The fourth antardasa of Sc runs during Aug 1984-Mar 1985. This is
the one that brought death.

Sc  is  the  8th  from  dasa  rasi  Ar.  So  the  first  antardasa  principle  we  described  is
correct. Ketu owns the the 8th from Ar and he is in Cp in navamsa. Sc aspects Cp and
the second principle is also satisfied.

Example 87: Let us consider the rasi chart of a male given in Chart 40. He expired
towards  the  end  of  1949.  Antardasa  at  the  time  of  death  does  not  follow  the
principles explained here, but dasa follows the Trishoola principle. Let us verify it.

The 8th lords from Ar and Li are Ketu and Venus. Venus  is stronger than Ketu. So
Venus is Rudra. He is in Cp and so Ta, Vi and Cp form Trishoola. Niryaana Shoola
dasa starts from the stronger of Ta and Sc. Sc is stronger as it has one planet. Sc is an
even rasi and normally dasas should go as Sc, Li, Vi etc. However, Saturn occupies
Sc and the “Saturn exception” applies. So dasas go as Sc, Sg, Cp etc. Sc dasa of 8
years ran during 1927-1935. Sg dasa of 9 years ran during 1935-1944. Cp dasa of 7
years ran during 1944-1951 and it brought death. As we have seen, Cp is a Trishoola
rasi.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

277

Chart 40

Using the principle of three pairs, we get “short life” as the result (lagna and 8th lord
show  short  life;  Moon  and  Saturn  show  short  life.  Lagna  and  HL  show  long  life).
That is why death came in Cp dasa and not in Ta or Vi dasa.

In fact, this native was a brilliant scholar of many subjects and also good astrologer.
He  knew  that  he  might  have  a  short  life.  He  was  sick  and  bed-ridden  during  his
college days. He missed most of his classes at college, but he studied on his own and
appeared  at  the  exams  with  special  permission  from  his  university  (there  was  a
minimum attendance requirement and he needed a waiver). Despite chronic sickness,
he graduated with distinction and first rank. He found a good job at a young age, but
chose not to marry till an age of 24. At his time, people in India used to get married
at  a  very  young  age.  He  thought  that  he  had  a  praanagandam  (danger  to  life)  and
decided to stay a bachelor till 24. He did not want to marry a lady knowing he might
pass away in a few years. He is an example of the positive use of astrology.

  278

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example  88:  Let  us  consider  the  rasi  chart  of  a  gentleman  shown  in  Chart  41.  He
passed away in 1967.

Chart 41

The 8th lords from Ge and Sg are Saturn and Moon. Saturn is stronger and becomes
Rudra. Trishoola is in Ta, Vi and Cp. Shiva’s Trishoola can strike the native (kill the
native) in one of the three dasas. Let us find dasas now.

The 8th house is stronger than the 2nd house and it starts dasas. As Cp is an even rasi,
dasas  normally  go  as  Cp,  Sg,  Sc  etc.  Here  they  go  as  Cp,  Aq,  Pi,  Ar  etc,  due  to
Saturn’s  presence  in  Cp.  We  can  see  that  Vi  dasa  starts  after  63  years
(7+8+9+7+8+9+7+8)61.  So  Vi  dasa  runs  during  March  1965-March  1974.  Being  a
Trishoola rasi, Vi brought death in its Niryaana Shoola dasa.

Exercise  31:  Consider  the  native  whose  rasi  chart  shown  in  Chart  42.  Using  the
method  of  three  pairs,  estimate  his  longevity  category.  Then  identify  the  dasa  of  a

61 One thumbrule that can help in calculating Niryaana Shoola dasa is that the sum of the first 3 dasas
is always 24 years (7+8+9). The sum of the next 3 dasas is also 24 years.

Trishoola rasi falling in that longevity category. Try to guess the antardasa of death.
Give the dates instead of just mentioning the dasa rasi and antardasa rasi.

Chart 42

22.3  Conclusion

Niryaana  Shoola  dasa  is  a  dasa  dedicated  to  timing  one’s  death.  Niryaana  means
death. In this author’s humble opinion, this dasa is the best for timing death. Usually
dasa of one of the three Trishoola rasis brings death. However, many special cases,
exceptions  and  special  rules  mentioned  by  Maharshis  were  omited  in  this  book.
Timing  of  the  antardasa  of  death  wasn’t  given  due  attention.  Readers  should  be
aware that what is taught here is only the tip of an iceberg. Further details are beyond
the scope of this book.

22.4  Answer to Exercise

  280

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Exercise 31:

Lagna  lord  and  8th  lord  is  Venus.  He  is  in  a  movable  rasi.  So  we  get  “long  life”.
Moon  and  Saturn  are  in  dual  and  movable  rasis.  So  we  get  “short  life”.  Lagna  and
HL are in movable and fixed rasis. So we get “middle life”. When there is a three-
way tie, we use the Moon-Saturn pair if Moon is in lagna or 7th. That is not the case
here.  So  we  use  the  lagna  and  horalagna  pair.  This  gives  “middle  life”  as  the
longevity category (36-72 years).

The 8th lord, Venus, and 8th lord from 7th, Mars, are in Aries. So Rudra is in Aries.
Trishoola rasis are Ar, Le and Sg. Death can happen in one of the three dasas.

As the 2nd house Sc is stronger due to the aspect of its lord, dasas start from Sc. As
Sc is even, they go as Sc, Li, Vi, Le etc. Ar dasa starts after 56 years (56=24+24+8;
24 years for Sc, Li and Vi; 24 years for Le, Cn and Ge; 8 years for Ta). So Ar dasa
starts on April 21, 1945 and runs for 7 years. The native is likely to pass away in this
period.

Antardasa is tough to guess. The 8th lords from Ar are Mars and Ketu. They are in Sc
in  navamsa.  The  signs  aspecting  it  are  Ar,  Cn,  Sc  and  Cp.  Of  these,  Sc  is  the
strongest candidate as it is also the 8th from dasa rasi Aries. However, the native died
in Aries antardasa itself (April 21, 1945-Nov 21, 1945), due to the strength of Aries
in rasi chart. Aries not only contains Rudra, but it is also the 7th house and it contains
2nd, 7th and 8th lords. It is a strong maraka sthana.

This birthdata belongs to Adolf Hitler. History says that committed suicide on April
30, 1945. Russian investigations after World War II supported this.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

281

23.  Shoola Dasa

23.1  Introduction

We looked at “Niryaana Shoola dasa” used for timing one’s death. There is another
dasa  called  Shoola  dasa  that  can  also  be  used  for  timing  death.  It  shows  death,
diseases, suffering and death of relatives.

23.2  Computation

Find the stronger of lagna and the 7th house. Dasas start there and always go in the
regular  zodiacal  order.  For  example,  if  lagna  is  in  Sc  and  Ta  is  stronger  than  Sc,
dasas go as Ta, Ge, Cn, Le etc. If lagna is in Le and Aq is stronger than Le, dasas go
as  Aq,  Pi,  Ar,  Ta  etc.  Each  dasa  is  of  9  years.  Each  dasa  is  divided  into  12  equal
antardasas. Antardasas are found using the same rules as dasas, but treating dasa rasi
as lagna. If Cn dasa is running and Cn is stronger than Cp, then antardasas go as Cn,
Le, Vi, Li etc and each antardasa will last 9 months.

Human  beings  live  in  the  womb  for  an  average  of  9  months.  For  animals  with  an
average of gestation period of n months, each dasa and antardasa will be of n years
and n months respectively.

In mundane astrology, we can use Shoola dasa by compressing 108 years to the time
period of effect of the chart. For example, suppose we want compressed Shoola dasa
for  the  swearing-in  chart  of  an  Indian  Prime  Minister.  Then,  108  years  of  Shoola
dasa are compressed to 5 years or 60 months (which is the term of an Indian Prime
Minister) and a dasa of 9 years is compressed 60/12 = 5 months.

23.3  Interpretation

Like in Niryana Shoola  dasa, dasa of a Trishoola rasi can bring death. Because the
2nd and 8th rasis in the natural zodiac are owned by Mars and Venus, rasi aspect on

  282

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

either  of  them  by  Moon  generates  Rudra  yoga  and  rasis  aspected  by  Rudra  yoga
planets can give death.

This author found the following rules to hold true in many cases:

“AL or the trines from it can give death. If malefics or marakas occupy or aspect the
3rd from AL or the 8th from AL, those 2 houses can give death.”

Lagna and 7th house both show the self of a person. They stand for the invisible and
visible  selves.  Niryaana  Shoola  dasa  starts  from  the  8th  house  from  one  of  them.
Niryaana  Shoola  dasa  essentially  shows  the  progress  of  the  8th  house.  It  shows  the
motion of praana (life). That is why it has an uneven motion. It goes forward in some
charts and backward in some charts. Also the lengths of dasas can be 7, 8 or 9 years.
All  this  shows  that  different  people  have  different  motion  of  praana.  When  praana
reaches  Shiva’s  Trishoola  or  a  powerful  maraka  rasi,  the  native  can  die.  In  Shoola
dasa,  however,  the  motion  has  a  constant  rate  of  9  years  per  dasa  and  the  order  of
dasas is always fixed. This fixed motion is like the motion of a quartz crystal.  It is
not  the  motion  of  praana  and  it  must  be  a  universal  motion.  It  is  suggested  that
Shoola  dasas  show  the  force  of  Lord  Shiva.  The  force  of  Lord  Shiva  starts  from
one’s  self  and  moves  at  a  constant  rate  in  a  fixed  direction.  So  Shoola  dasa  rasi
hitting  Trishoola  rasis  is  less  significant  than  Niryaana  Shoola  dasa  rasi  hitting
Trishoola  rasis.  In  the  case  of  Shoola  dasa,  death  occurs  when  Shiva’s  motion  hits
AL  or  the  trines  from  it  or  the  houses  of  vitality  from  AL  (3rd  and  8th).  AL  is
involved instead of lagna, because our existence is a maya (illusion) and what Lord
Shiva  destroys  is  the  illusion  of  our  existence.  The  physical  body  (lagna)  simply
merges  with  the  material  universe,  when  burnt  or  buried,  and  the  perceived  self  or
the maya  of existence (AL) is what is completely destroyed by Lord Shiva.

Lesson: Niryaana Shoola dasa shows the motion of praana (life). Death occurs when
praana hits maraka rasis and the trines from Rudra (Trishoola rasis). Shoola dasa is
the  reverse.  It  shows  the  motion  of  Shiva.  Death  occurs  primarily  when  Shiva’s
motion hits the trines from AL or the 3rd house from AL or the 8th house from AL.

We  have  listed  several  rasis  above.  How  do  we  choose  one  answer  from  the  list?
There are 2  criteria: (1)  Usually  a  rasi occupied  or aspected by  AK or Jupiter does
not  kill  a  native,  unless  that  planet  happens  to  be  Rudra.  (2)  Based  on  whether  the
native is of short/middle/long life, we are limited to just 4 dasas. The first 4 Shoola

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

283

dasas  (0-36  years)  bring  death  to  a  person  of  the  short  life  category.  The  middle  4
Shoola dasas (36-72  years) bring death to a person of the middle life category. The
last 4 Shoola dasas (72-108 years) bring death to a person of the long life category.
We should choose a good candidate from those dasas.

23.4  Examples

Example  89:  Let  us  revisit  Example  84  that  we  analyzed  using  Niryaana  Shoola
dasa.

Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Sc. They go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc. Each dasa
is of 9 years. First 5 dasas are over after 45  years. The native died in the 50th year.
From his 45th year, the 6th dasa was running. So the 6th dasa of Ar killed the native.
One can see that Ar is a trine from AL. It is the only trine in the middle life range.

Example  90:  Let  us  revisit  Example  85  that  we  analyzed  using  Niryaana  Shoola
dasa.

Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Le. They go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc. Each dasa is
of  9  years.  First  5  dasas  are  over  after  45  years.  The  native  died  in  his  47th  year.
From his 45th year, the 6th dasa was running. So the 6th dasa of Cp killed the native.
One can see that Cp is the only trine from AL in the middle life range.

Example  91:  Let  us  revisit  Example  86  that  we  analyzed  using  Niryaana  Shoola
dasa.

The 7th house Cp is stronger and dasas start from Cp. They go as Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc.
Each dasa is of 9 years. First 7 dasas are over after 63 years. The native died in her
67th year. From her 63rd year, the 8th dasa was running. So the 8th dasa of Le killed
the native. One can see that Le is a trine from AL and it contains the lord of AL. So
Shiva destroyed the material existence of the native in Cp’s Shoola dasa.

Example  92:  Let  us  revisit  Example  87  that  we  analyzed  using  Niryaana  Shoola
dasa.

  284

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Lagna is stronger and dasas start from Ar. They go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn etc. Each dasa
is of 9 years. First 2 dasas are over after 18 years. The native died in the 23rd year.
From his 18th year, the 3rd dasa was running. So the 3rd dasa of Ge killed the native.
One can see that Ge is the 8th house from AL (see Table 3262) and it contains Rahu.
In other words, Ge is afflicted and it is the house of longevity of material self. When
Shiva’s motion hit that rasi, the native died.

Exercise  32:  Consider  the  native  of  Chart  43.  Using  the  method  of  three  pairs,
estimate whether he has short or middle or long life. Then evaluate Shoola dasa and
identify the four dasas in the estimated longevity range. Consider the trines from AL
and the 3rd and 8th houses (using Table 32). Think hard and choose the dasa that must
have given death.

23.5  Death of Near Relatives

Shoola  dasa  shows  Shiva’s  punishment.  It  shows  misfortune,  suffering  and  death.
Using it, death of near relatives can also be timed.

For  each  relative,  we  treat  the  house  that  shows  him/her  as  lagna  and  find  Shoola
dasa based on it. Shoola dasa starts from the stronger of that rasi and the 7th from it.
We  have  different  names  for  Shoola  dasas  started  from  different  houses.  For
example,  Pitri  Shoola  dasa  (pitri  =  father)  starts  from  the  stronger  of  9th  and  3rd
houses.  It  is  used  in  the  timing  of  father’s  death.  Bhratri  Shoola  dasa  (bhratri  =
brother) also starts from the stronger of 3rd and 9th houses and it shows the death of
younger siblings. Matri Shoola dasa (matri = mother) starts from the stronger of 4th
and 10th houses. Dara Shoola dasa (dara = wife) starts from the stronger of 7th and 1st
houses  and  it  shows  the  death  of  wife  (this  dasa  will  be  identical  to  the  native’s
normal Shoola dasa). Putra Shoola dasa (putra = son) starts from the stronger of 5th
and 11th houses and it shows the death of a child.

We mentioned earlier that sthira karakas are useful in timing death. Sthira karaka of
father represents father in a chart, for the purpose of matters controlled by Shiva (i.e.
suffering  and  death).  Pitri  Shoola  dasa  shows  the  motion  of  Shiva’s  force  for  the
father. When Shiva’s force strikes trines from sthira karaka of father, father’s death
can take place. Trines from the corresponding arudha pada can also give death.

Similarly,  we  can  time  the  death  of  other  near  relatives.  Let  us  see  a  couple  of
examples.

Example 93: Let us consider the native of Chart 44. His father passed away in the
second half of 1995.

Exalted Sun joins Mercury and Jupiter aspects him. So Sun is stronger than Venus.
He becomes sthira pitri karaka (fixed significator of father). Death can occur in trines
from  him,  i.e.  Ar,  Le  and  Sg.  Pitri  pada  (A9,  arudha  pada  of  9th  house)  is  in  Sg.
Trines from it are the same.

The 9th house is in Aq. Among Aq and Le, Aq is stronger as its lord Rahu is in a rasi
with a different oddity. Dasas go as Aq, Pi, Ar etc.

  286

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Dasa of Aq  runs during  1971-1980. Dasa of Pi runs during 1980-1989.  Dasa of Ar
runs  during  1989-1998.  Death  occurred  in  this  dasa.  As  already  noted,  Ar  contains
sthira karaka of father and it is a trine from A9.

Chart 44

Example 94: Let us consider Indira Gandhi’s birthdata given in Chart 61 (in a later
chapter).  Her  father  Jawaharlal  Nehru  died  in  May  1964.  Her  husband  Feroze
Gandhi died in 1960. Her son Sanjay Gandhi died in June 1980.

Sthira karaka of father is Venus here, as he is in a dual rasi. He shows father, for the
purpose  of  matters  ruled  by  Shiva.  Death  of  father  can  occur  in  the  trines  from
Venus, i.e. Sg, Ar and Le. Pitri Shoola dasa starts from Pi (9th house) and goes as Pi,
Ar, Ta, Ge etc. Le dasa starts after 5 dasas, i.e. in 1917 + 45 = 1962. It runs till 1971.
Her father died in 1964 in this dasa.

Jupiter  is  sthira  karaka  of  husband.  He  shows  husband,  for  the  purpose  of  matters
ruled by Shiva. Death of husband can occur in trines from Jupiter. Dara Shoola dasa

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

287

starts from Cp and goes as Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar etc. Jupiter is in Ta and Ta dasa runs from
1917 + 36 = 1953. It ends in 1962. Her husband died in 1960 in this dasa.

Jupiter  is  also  sthira  karaka  of  children.  He  shows  children,  for  the  purpose  of
matters ruled by Shiva. Death of son can occur in trines from Jupiter. Putra Shoola
dasa starts from Sc (5th house and stronger than Ta) and goes as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc.
Jupiter is in Ta and Ta dasa runs from 1917 + 54 = 1971. It ends in November 1980.
Her son Sanjay Gandhi died in June 1980. He died in Ta dasa.

Exercise  33:  Consider  the  rasi  chart  of  a  lady  born  in  1950,  given  in  Chart  45.
Compute  Shoola  dasa  and  identify  the  dasas  that  can  give  death  to  her  husband.
Looking  at  the  3rd  from  sthira  karaka  for  husband,  guess  whether  the  death  was
violent or peaceful.

23.6  Answers to Exercises

Exercise 32:

  288

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Method  of  three  pairs:  (1)  Lagna  lord  and  8th  lord  is  Venus  and  he  is  in  dual  rasi.
Dual + Dual gives middle life. (2) Moon is in a fixed rasi and Saturn is in a dual rasi.
Fixed  +  Dual  gives  long  life.  (3)  Lagna  and  HL  are  in  movable  rasis.  Movable  +
Movable gives long life. So the final result is “long life”. This range covers 72-108
years. So the last 4 Shoola dasas can bring death.

Shoola dasa: The 7th house Aries is stronger as it has the aspect of Sun, Mercury and
its lord Mars. Dasas start from Ar and go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn etc. The first 8 dasas are
over after 72  years (8  x 9). The 9th dasa of Sg runs during 72-81  years of age. The
10th dasa of Cp runs during 81-90 years of age. The 11th dasa of Aq runs during 90-
99 years of age. The 12th dasa of Pi runs during 99-108 years of age. These are the
four dasas in the long life range.

Death when: Arudha lagna is in Aq. The trines are Aq, Ge and Li. The only trine in
the long life range, i.e. among the 4 rasis mentioned above, is Aq. Its dasa can give
death. However, it contains Jupiter who is also AK. So its dasa is unlikely to kill. We
can try the 8th house from AL. From Table 32, we find that Cp is the 8th house from
Aq. It is afflicted by Rahu here (just as in Example 92). So it is a good candidate.

Final  Answer:  This  chart  belongs  to  Frank  Sinatra,  a  legendary  singer  and  actor  of
US. He died of a heart attack on May 14, 1998. He died in his 83rd year. Shoola dasa
of Cp was running then.

Exercise 33:

Shoola  dasa  starts  from  Sg  and  goes  thus  –  Sg:  1950-1959,  Cp:  1959-1968,  Aq:
1968-1977,  Pi:  1977-1986,  Ar:  1986-1995,  Ta:  1995-2004,  Ge:  2004-2013.  Sthira
karaka of husband is Jupiter and he is in Cp. So death can occur in Cp, Ta and Vi. Of
these, Cp dasa comes too early. Most likely candidate is Ta dasa (1995-2004).

Sthira karaka for husband is Jupiter. The 3rd from him is Pi, occupied by Moon and
Rahu. Mars also aspects it. So the death is likely to be violent.

Husband of this lady passed away in a road accident in 2000.

24.  Kalachakra Dasa

24.1  Introduction

Sage Parasara said in his classic “Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram”:

It  means,  “there  is  another  dasa  called  Kalachakra  dasa,  which  is  the  most
respectable of all dasa systems”. Kalachakra literally means “the wheel of Time”. It
shows how the wheel of time unfolds events in the life of an individual. Parasara said
that Lord Shiva explained this dasa to Goddess Parvati.

24.2  Computation

Nakshatras  are  divided  into  two  groups  –  Savya  (zodiacal)  group  and  Apasavya
(anti-zodiacal group), as shown in Table 42. Note that the first 3 nakshatras belong to
the savya group, the next 3 constellations to the apasavya group and so on.

Savya Group

Apasavya Group

Parasara taught that we can draw Kalachakra (wheel of Time) by drawing 2 sets of
12  houses  for  savya  and  apasavya  groups  of  nakshatras,  then  repeating  them  and

  290

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

distributing them between nakshatras. Savya means “zodiacal” and apasavya means
“anti-zodiacal”.

We write the 12 rasis in one set (either zodiacally or anti-zodiacally). In the other set,
we  write  their  mirror  images,  i.e.  the  other  sign  owned  by  the  same  planet.  The
mirror image of Ar is Sc. The mirror image of Ta is Li. The mirror image of Cp is
Aq. However, the mirror image of Cn is Cn itself and that of Le is Le itself, as they
are  the  only  signs  owned  by  their  lords.  The  main  sequence  and  the  mirrored
sequence together form a sequence of 24 rasis. We have two such sequences – one
for  the  savya  group  and  the  other  for  the  apasavya  group  (see  Table  43).  We  find
antardasas and dasas by repeating these 24-rasi sequences and going through them.

The  first  pada  (quarter)  of  Aswini  is  associated  with  the  first  9  rasis  in  the  savya
group above (Ar, Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg). The dasa running at birth will be
one of these 9 rasis and one will run dasas of 9 rasis starting from that rasi. One born
with Moon at the beginning of the first pada of Aswini will run Ar dasa at birth and
run  Ta,  Ge,  Cn,  Le,  Vi,  Li,  Sc  and  Sg  dasas  after  it.  One  born  with  Moon  in  the
middle of the first pada of Awini may run Le dasa at birth and run Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, Cp,
Aq, Pi and Sc dasas after it. One born with Moon towards the end of the first pada of
Aswini may run Sg dasa at birth and Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn and Le dasas after it.
Based  on  the  elapsed  fraction  of  the  1st  pada  of  Aswini,  we  choose  the  initial  dasa
from  the  9  rasis  associated  with  that  nakshatra  pada  and  then  proceed  along
Kalachakra and list 9 rasis starting from it. The second pada of Aswini is associated
with the next 9 rasis in the savya group above (Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge).

Like this, as we go from one nakshatra pada (constellation quarter) to the next in the
savya group, we move from one set of 9 rasis to the next. When we reach the end of
the  24  rasis,  we  go  to  the  beginning.  In  this  manner,  we  can  find  a  set  of  9  rasis

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

291

associated with each nakshatra pada. The first of the nine rasis is called “Deha rasi”
(body sign) and the last one is called “Jeeva rasi” (spirit/life sign).

At the end of the 4th quarter of Aswini, the 1st quarter of Bharani starts and we do the
same thing. We go to the next 9 rasis in the set of 24 rasis.

We  can  do  the  same  thing  in  the  case  of  apasavya  nakshatras  and  use  the  24-rasi
sequence  given  for  the  apasavya  group  in  Table  43.  In  the  case  of  apasavya
nakshatras, the first rasi in the nine rasis corresponding to a nakshatra pada is called
“Jeeva  rasi”  and  the  last  one  is  called  “Deha  rasi”  (note  that  the  definition  has
reversed).

For the sake of those who do not understand the above logic well enough to list the
nine rasis associated with each nakshatra pada, they are explicitly given in Table 44-
Table 47. For the purpose of these tables, we will divide savya and apasavya groups
of nakshatras into two sub-groups each.

It may be noted in the tables above that there is a column called “paramaayush”. This
gives the sum of the dasas of the nine rasis associated with the constellation quarter.
We  now  need  to  define  the  durations  of  various  dasas.  The  duration  of  a  dasa  is
based in its owner, as shown in Table 48. Two rasis owned by the same planet have
the same duration.

Let us go through the procedure used in finding dasas and antardasas, in case it is not
yet obvious to the reader:

(1) Find  the  nakshatra  pada  occupied  by  natal  Moon.  Identify  the  9-rasi  sequence
associated with it, using Table 44-Table 47. Also, note down the paramayush.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

293

(2) Find the fraction of the nakshatra pada that was covered by Moon at birth.
(3) Find  the  same  fraction  of  the  paramayush.  That  represents  the  portion  of  the
paramayush (dasas of the nine rasis) that was over before birth. Based on this, we
can find which of the nine dasas runs at birth and how much of the dasa remains
at birth.

(4) After this dasa, we go to the next rasi in the nine rasis. When we finish the nine
rasis  of  the  nakshatra  pada,  we  go  to  the  nine  rasis  of  the  next  nakshatra  pada.
After  the  nine  rasis  of  the  4th  pada  of  a  nakshatra,  we  go  to  the  nine  rasis
corresponding  to  the  1st  pada  of  the  next  nakshatra  (i.e.  1st  pada  of  the
constellations belonging to the other sub-group in the same group). For example,
after  the  nine  rasis  of  the  4th  pada  of  Savya-1  constellations,  we  go  to  the  nine
rasis of the 1st pada of Savya-2 constellations. After the nine rasis of the 4th pada
of Apasavya-2 constellations, we go to the nine rasis of the 1st pada of Apasavya-
1 constellations.

(5) In each dasa, antardasas start from dasa rasi itself. After the first antardasa, we go
to  the  next  rasi.  After  that,  we  go  to  the  next  rasi.  And  so  on.  We  take  9  rasis
starting  from  dasa  rasi  and  antardasas  will  belong  to  those  rasis.  We  distribute
the  dasa  length  among  the  9  antardasas  proportionally  (in  proportion  to  their
respective dasa lengths as given in Table 48). If we reach the end of the nine rasis
corresponding  to  the  nakshatra  pada  when  counting  9  rasis  from  dasa  rasi,  we
proceed to the next nakshatra pada as described in rule (4) above.

All this may seem complicated to a casual reader, but it must be obvious to anyone
who clearly understood Kalachakra shown in Table 43 and followed how Table 44-
Table 47 are derived from it. A couple of examples may make this clearer.

Example  95:  Suppose  Moon  is  at  15Ta50  in  someone’s  natal  chart.  Let  us  find
Kalachakra dasa for him.

Moon is in Rohini 2nd pada, which runs from 13Ta20 to 16Ta40. From Table 46, we
find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatra pada are: Vi,  Li, Sc, Pi, Aq, Cp,
Sg, Sc, Li.

The amount of the nakshatra pada traversed by Moon is 15º50' – 13º20' = 2º30'. The
fraction  of  the  nakshatra  pada63  traversed  by  Moon  is  (2º30')/(3º20')  =  150'/200'  =
0.75.  The  same  fraction  of  paramayush  (83  years)  is  0.75  x  83  =  62.25  years.  So
62.25 years out of the 83 years were over before birth. We see from Table 49 that 60
years were over by the end of Sg dasa and 2.25 years of Sc dasa added to it makes it
62.25  years.  So  Sc  dasa  was  running  at  birth  and  7  –  2.25  =  4.75  years  of  Sc  dasa
were remaining at birth. By adding 4 years 9 months to the birthdate, we get the date
on which Sc dasa ends. Then  Li dasa of 16  years will run till an age of  20  years  9
months. With Li dasa, we finish the nine rasis associated with the 2nd pada of Rohini
(Apasavya-1). So we go to the 3rd pada in the same table. The next 7 dasas64 will be
Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg. Their lengths are as given in Table 48.65

Example  96:  Suppose  Moon  is  at  3Cn00  in  someone’s  natal  chart.  Let  us  find
Kalachakra dasa for him.

Moon  is  in  Punarvasu  4th  pada,  which  runs  from  0Cn00  to  3Cn20.  From  Table  44,
we find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatra pada are: Cn, Le, Vi,  Li, Sc,
Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi.

The fraction of the pada traversed by Moon is (3º0')/( 3º20') = 180'/200' = 0.9. The
same fraction of paramayush (86 years) is 0.9  x 86 = 77.4 years. So 77.4 out of the
86  years  were over before birth. We see from Table 50 that 76  years  were over by
the  end  of  Aq  dasa  and  1.4  years  of  Pi  dasa  added  to  it  makes  it  77.4  years.  So  Pi
dasa was running at birth and 10 – 1.4 = 8.6 years of Pi dasa were remaining at birth.

63 The complete length of each nakshatra pada is 3º20'.
64  Parasara  suggested  taking  the  dasas  of  nine  rasis  starting  from  the  rasi  whose  dasa  is  running  at
birth. Sc dasa was running at birth and Sc and Li dasas belong to the set of nine rasis associated with
Rohini 2nd pada. We already have 2 rasis. So we just need 7 rasis from the next pada.
65 We again have the issue of solar years vs savana years. This author prefers savana years with all
nakshatra dasas. Kalachakra dasa is a nakshatra dasa.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

295

By adding 8 years 7 months 6 days to the birthdate, we get the date on which Pi dasa
ends. With Pi dasa, we finish the nine rasis associated with the 4th pada of Punarvasu
(Savya-1).  So  we  go  to  the  1st  pada  of  Savya-2  nakshatras  (Table  45).  The  next  8
dasas will be Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar. Their lengths are as given in Table 48.

Exercise  34:  Suppose  Moon  is  at  5Aq50  in  someone’s  natal  chart.  Let  us  find
Kalachakra dasa for him.

Example 97: Let us find the antardasa sequences in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th dasas in
Example 95.

The 1st dasa is Sc (from the 2nd pada of Apasavya-1 constellations). We should start
from Sc and find 9 rasis. After Sc, we have Li and the 9 rasis corresponding to the
2nd pada end there (see Table 46). So the next 7 rasis should be taken from the 9 rasis
corresponding to the next pada, i.e. 3rd pada. So we get antardasas in Sc dasa as Sc,
Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg.66

Similarly, one can see that antardasas in Li dasa (2nd dasa) go as Li, Vi, Le, Cn, Ge,
Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp. Antardasas in Vi dasa (3rd dasa) go as Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp,
Aq. Antardasas in Le dasa (4th dasa) go as Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi.

One can notice that dasa sequences and antardasa sequences all come from the two
24-rasi  sequences  given  in  Kalachakra  (see  Table  43).  In  the  cases  of  dasas,  the
starting point in the 24-rasi sequence is determined by the nakshatra pada of Moon
and the portion elapsed in it. In the case of antardasas, the starting point is based on
dasa rasi.

To  learn  how  the  lengths  of  antardasas  are  computed,  let  us  take  Le  dasa  as  an
example. We found that antardasas in Le dasa are Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi.
By adding the dasa lengths of these 9 rasis (see  Table 48), we  get 86  years. So we
divide Le dasa of 5 years into 86 parts and give 5 parts to Le antardasa, 21 parts to
Cn antardasa, 9 parts to Ge antardasa and so on.

66 However, we see from Example 95 that 2.25 years of Sc dasa were over before birth. So some of
these antardasas may be over before birth.

24.3  Interpretation

24.3.1  Basics

Dasa of a rasi gives the natural results of the rasi. For example, dasa of Pisces may
give  saattwik  religious  activities.  Dasa  of  Aries  may  give  enterprise  or  quarrels  or
wounds.

More importantly, dasa of a rasi gives the results of the house and planets in that rasi.
If  Aries  has  the  5th  house  in  D-7,  its  dasa  may  give  children.  If  Pisces  has  the  8th
house in D-6, its dasa may give diseases. If Gemini has lagna in D-24, its dasa may
give all-round progress in the accumulation of knowledge. If Sc has AL in D-10 and
its lord Mars occupies it, its dasa may bring good developments related to career and
status. Dasa of a rasi containing the 8th from AL in D-10 may give a fall in status at
workplace. Dasa of a  rasi may  also give the results of its lord.  If Mars is  in the 5th
house in D-7, Aries dasa may give children.

Samudaaya Ashtakavarga (SAV) plays an important role in deciding the results in a
dasa. If a rasi has too many or too few rekhas in SAV of a particular divisional chart,
then its dasa may bring favorable or unfavorable results, respectively, relating to the
significations of that house in that divisional chart. Usually dasas of rasis with 30 or
more  rekhas  in  D-10  SAV  bring  the  best  phases  in  one’s  career  and  dasas  of  rasis
with  30  or  more  rekhas  in  in  D-24  SAV  bring  the  best  periods  for  learning.  One
should keep SAV of various divisional charts with one when interpreting Kalachakra
dasa.

24.3.2  Deha and Jeeva Rasis

In Table 44-Table 47, we listed the deha and jeeva rasis of different nakshatra padas.
However,  these  hold  for  one  born  at  the  beginning  of  the  nakshatra  pada.  One  can
have  different  deha  and  jeeva  rasis  based  on  the  elapsed  portion  in  the  nakshatra
pada.

Deha and jeeva rasis are simply the rasis of the first and the ninth dasas in the case
of one born in a savya nakshatra. In the case of one born in an apasavya nakshatra,
deha and jeeva rasis are the rasis of the ninth and the first dasas.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

297

In  Example  95,  the  first  dasa  is  Sc  and  the  ninth  dasa  is  Sg.  Since  Rohini  is  an
apasavya  nakshatra,  Sc  becomes  jeeva  rasi  and  Sg  becomes  deha  rasi.  In  Example
96, the first dasa is Pi and the ninth dasa is Ar. Since Punarvasu is a savya nakshatra,
Pi becomes deha rasi and Ar becomes jeeva rasi.

Deha  rasi  shows  body  and  jeeva  rasi  shows  the  spirit.  Benefics  and  malefics
transiting  in  them  affect  them  positively  and  negatively  (respectively).  If  Jupiter,
Mercury  and  Venus  are  transiting  in  one’s  jeeva  rasi,  one  may  exhibit  a  positive
spirit  and  be  cheerful.  If  Mars,  Sun,  Saturn  and  Rahu  are  transiting  in  one’s  jeeva
rasi,  one  may  be  without  any  enthusiasm.  If  Mars,  Sun,  Saturn  and  Rahu  are
transiting in one’s deha rasi, one may face accidents or death.

24.3.3  Gatis (special movements)

We see that dasas progress in a regular fashion in Kalachakra dasa. We either go as
Ar, Ta, Ge etc or as Pi, Aq, Cp etc. However, some irregularities can be found. The
rasis  whose  dasas  come  after  an  irregular  leap  go  by  special  names  and  special
results are attributed to those dasas in classics.

(1) A trinal leap (from Sg to Ar or vice versa; from Pi to Sc or vice versa) is called

“Simhaavalokana gati” (lion’s leap)67.

(2) Temporary  reversal  of  the  direction  is  called  “Markati  gati”  (monkey’s  leap).
When  we  go  as  Sc,  Li,  Vi,  Cn,  Le,  Ge,  Ta,  Ar  etc  in  savya  nakshatras,  we
temporarily reverse the direction when we go from Cn to Le. So Le is a markati
gati rasi. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Le, Cn, Vi, Li, Sc etc in apasavya
nakshatras, we temporarily reverse the direction when we go from Le to Cn. So
Cn is a markati gati rasi.

(3) Leaving  one  rasi  and  jumping  over  it  is  called  “Mandooki  gati”  (frog’s  leap).
When we go as Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar etc in savya nakshatras, we have 2
jumps  –  (i)  from  Vi  to  Cn  and  (ii)  Le  to  Ge.  So  Cn  and  Ge  are  mandooki  gati
rasis.  Similarly,  when  we  go  as  Ar,  Ta,  Ge,  Le,  Cn,  Vi,  Li,  Sc  etc  in  apasavya
nakshatras, we have 2 jumps – (i) from Ge to Le and (ii) Cn to Vi. So Le and Vi
are mandooki gati rasis.

67  Simhavalokana  doesn’t  really  mean  a  lion.  It  strictly  means  a  lion’s  view  of  the  jungle  from  an
elevated vantage point.

In  addition,  Parasara  listed  the  directions  to  prefer  and  the  directions  avoid,  while
travelling and relocating, during different leaps.

(1)  In  the  leap  from  Vi  to  Cn,  east  will  give  great  results.  One  can  take  up  an

auspicious journey in the northern direction.

(2)  In  the  leap  from  Le  to  Ge,  east  should  be  avoided.  A  journey  to  the  southwest

will be fruitful.

(3)  In  the  leap  from  Cn  to  Le,  a  move  in  the  southern  direction  results  in  losses.

West is favorable.

(4)  In the leap from Pi to Sc and in the normal movement from Sg to Cp, there will

be troubles in the northern direction.

(5)  In  the  leap  from  Sg  to  Ar,  journeys  should  be  avoided,  as  they  may  result  in

sickness, imprisonment or death.

(6)  In the normal movement from Sg to Sc, journeys will bring comforts, wealth and

sexual pleasures.

(7)  In the leap from Le to Cn, western direction should be avoided.

24.4  Practical Examples

Example 98: The navamsa chart of a male who got married in Dec 1994 is shown in
Chart 46.

Readers can verify that the native had about 5 years of Sc dasa left at birth and the
next dasas are Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Sc, Li, Vi, Cn. At the time of wedding, the native was
running Pi-Pi (Pi dasa & Pi antardasa). Why did Pisces give marriage?

Well, it has lagna in navamsa and its lord Jupiter is in the 7th house! Naturally Pi and
Vi  are  the  front-runners  for  giving  marriage.  Moreover,  Pi  is  the  2nd  from  Venus.
Venus  symbolizes  domestic  happiness  and  marital  bliss.  The  2nd  from  him  in
navamsa can show the sense of family happiness. It can show a new person coming
into the family.

In addition, one may note that exalted Venus occupies Pi in rasi chart and he owns
darapada,  which  is  in  Libra.  So  Pisces  is  conducive  to  physical  relationship  and
marital pleasures.

Venus  is  in  Aq  in  navamsa.  While  rasi  shows  what  exists  at  the  physical  level,
navamsa  shows  the  inner  self  and  the  sense  of  connectedness.  So  Aq  dasa  can
activate  Venusian  influence  at  navamsa  level  and  give  some  romance.  During  Aq
dasa  (1990-1994),  this  native  had  a  love  affair  with  the  lady  he  was  to  marry  in
December 1994.

  300

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 46

Example  99:  The  D-24  shown  in  Chart  47  belongs  to  an  astrologer.  He  learnt
astrology  at  a  young  age,  but  he  has  been  seriously  into  astrology  since  1993.  In
particular,  1996-2000  was  a  very  fruitful  period.  Knowledge  came  to  him  like  rain
from  monsoon  clouds.  He  never  felt  as  fulfilled  as  he  did  with  the  knowledge  that
came to him in 1996-2000.

One may note that about 3 years and 2 months of Sg dasa was left at birth and Ar,
Ta, Ge, Cn etc dasas run after it. One may find that Gemini dasa of 9 years started in
1996. This dasa brought fine knowledge and intellectual satisfaction. Why?

Gemini  contains  lagna  in  D-24.  Lagna  stands  for  all-round  progress.  This  is  D-24
and lagna in it shows all-round progress related to learning and knowledge. Its lord
Mercury  is  in  the  5th  house  of  scholarship  from  lagna.  So  this  dasa  can  increase
scholarship.  Mercury  and  Venus  are  in  trines  from  Ge  and  they  contribute  to  the
prosperity  of  the  indications  of  Ge.  Moreover,  Ge  is  very  strong  in  D-24  with  34
rekhas  in  SAV.  Any  rasi  30  or  more  rekhas  brings  favorable  results  related  to  that
house in that divisional chart.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

301

Chart 47

The strongest houses in this D-24 SAV are Le (36 rekhas), Ge (34 rekhas) and Pi (33
rekhas).  They  are  the  7th,  5th  and  2nd  houses  from  AL.  As  these  are  the  houses
conducive  to  recognition  and  awards,  this  D-24  shows  a  person  with  academic
achievements and associated recognition. With Ge being the 5th house from AL and
also A5, this dasa can bring some reputation for his knowledge. So this dasa brings
knowledge, scholarship and also recognition for it.

Example  100:  Let  us  consider  the  native  whose  D-12  is  given  in  Chart  48.  father
passed away in 1967.

We can see that about 1 year and 8 months of Pi dasa was remaining at birth and the
dasas  coming  after  it  are  Sc,  Li,  Vi,  Cn,  Le,  Ge,  Ta  and  Ar.  Cn  dasa  started  in
September 1966 and Cn-Cn antardasa was running at the time of his father’s demise.

  302

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 48

Lagna  in  D-12  is  in  Vi.  The  9th  house  is  in  Ta.  The  9th  house  in  D-12  shows  the
relation with father and the associated happiness. It stands for the “concept” of father
and paternal guidance. The “physical body” of the father is an illusion related to the
concept  of  father  and  A9  represents  it.  So  we  can  use  the  9th  lord  or  A9 to  see  the
physical body of father. Here A9 is in Cp. Taking Cp as lagna, we see that Cn is the
7th  house  of  death  and  its  lord  Moon  is  exalted.  Moon  is  not  only  exalted,  but  he
afflicts Sun, who owns the 8th house from Cp. So Cn-Cn antardasa can result in the
death of father. Moreover, Cn dasa here comes after Vi and involves mandooki gati
(frog’s  leap).  We  see  from  the  previous  discussions  that  mandooki  gati  in  savya
nakshatras can bring distress to father.

Exercise 35: The native of Example 100 lost his mother in Li-Li antardasa. Why?

Example 101: Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s birthdata and D-10 chart is given in Chart 3. He
has been India’s Prime Minister since March 1998.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

303

About 4.5 years of Vi dasa was left at birth. The dasas to follow are Le, Cn, Ge, Ta,
Ar, Sg, Cp and Aq. His 4-year Cp dasa runs during 1998-2002.

We can see that Cp has 31 rekhas in the SAV of D-10 and 34 rekhas in the SAV of
rasi chart. Because Cp is strong in both charts, Cp dasa must be good.

The houses having 30 or more rekhas are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th houses from AL.
Most  of  these  houses  are  important  for  fame  and  recognition  (and  AL  is  the  most
appropriate  reference  for  judging  fame  and  recognition).  The  strength  of  these
houses in D-10 SAV means that the native has a successful and famous career. Being
the 5th house from AL, Cp can bring reputation and power. Moreover, the lord of Cp
is exalted in GL. In addition, Cp contains A5 in rasi chart and D-10. A5 shows the
illusion  associated  with  the  5th  house  matters.  In  D-24,  A5  shows  the  illusion
associated with scholarship (5th house), i.e. one’s degrees, academic distinctions and
awards. In D-10, it shows the illusion associated with one’s following (5th house), i.e.
the positions held and the power wielded by one. For this reason, the presence of A5
in Cp adds to the probability of power in Cp dasa.

Example  102:  Let  us  revisit  Example  82.  Chart  49  gives  the  D-20  chart  of  the
devotee whose rasi chart was considered in that example.

Ta dasa of about 9.5 years was left at birth. The dasas to follow are Ar, Pi, Aq, Cp,
Sg, Ar, Ta and Ge. Pi dasa started in July 1987 and Sg antardasa in it was running
when he moved to the monastery.

Pi and Sg are owned by Jupiter and they can give religious knowledge. Pi is the 12th
house  in  D-20  and  Sg  is  the  9th  house.  The  12th  house  in  D-20  shows  spiritual
evolution  and  activities  related  to  moksha.  It  has  33  rekhas  in  SAV  and  hence  it  is
strong.  So  its  dasa  can  take  in  the  direction  of  liberation  from  material  bonds  and
evolution of soul.

  304

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 49

The antardasa sign Sg is the 9th house from lagna. The 9th house shows guidance. In
D-20, it shows one’s spiritual guru or organized religion or religious practices. It can
also show pilgrimages. It can certainly show moving to a monastery. Darapada (A7)
of D-20 is in Sg. The 7th house shows relations  with others.  Its arudha pada shows
the  illusion  associated  with  relationships  or  the  things  based  on  which  the  world
forms  an  impression  about  one’s  relationship  with  others.  It  shows  the  people  one
associates  with.  Darapada  in  D-20  shows  the  people  one  associates  with,  in  one’s
spiritual life. So antardasa of the rasi containing darapada in D-20 can bring him to
the people he will associate with for the rest of his religious life. With Sg containing
Sun,  natural  significator  of  soul,  and  the  nodes,  his  soul  went  through  a  churning
during Sg antardasa and he wandered in forests thinking about what life is. But Sg is
also the 9th house and its antardasa brought him to a monastery before its end.

The  next  antardasa  belonged  to  Ar,  which  contains  lagna.  So  there  was  all-round
progress  in  spiritual  matters.  Ar  has  33  rekhas  in  D-20  SAV  and  it  is  strong.  In
addition,  Ar  contains  A5  (mantra  pada,  arudha  pada  of  the  5th  house)  and  this
antardasa may have brought some religious initiation and practice of some mantras.
It  should  be  noted  that  the  5th  house  in  D-20  shows  one’s  devotion  and  bhakti  in

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

305

religious  matters.  A5  shows  the  maya  relating  to  devotion,  i.e.  practice  of  mantras
and religious rituals.

One  may  note  that  the  3rd  house  (Ge)  and  A3  (Li)  have  30  or  more  rekhas  in  the
SAV.  The  3rd  house  shows  one’s  communication  skills.  In  D-20,  it  shows
communication  skills  as  applicable  in  religious  activities.  A3  shows  the  associated
illusion,  i.e.  the  things  based  on  which  the  world  forms  impressions  about  one’s
communication skills. It can show the books and articles authored by one. In D-20, it
shows one’s religious works. If one casts D-10 of this native, one will see that the 3rd
house and A3 have 30 or more rekhas, in D-10 SAV also. Houses with 30 or more
rekhas in SAV are strengthened as per Parasara. So the 3rd house and A3 are strong
in  both  D-20  and  D-10.  One  can  conclude  that  this  native  will  be  a  good
communicator and will be known for some religious literature. In fact, he is already
authoring a translation of “Sreemadbhaagavatam” into his mother tongue and travels
with some ISKCON gurus as an interpreter. A lot of worthy religious literature and
translations will emerge from the pen of this blessed soul in the years to come.

Exercise  36:  The  lady  whose  rasi  and  navamsa  charts  are  given  in  Chart  50  was
married  in  Sg  dasa  and  divorced  in  the  same  dasa.  Sg  contains  Venus,  the
significator of marriage. However, Venus also owns the 2nd and 7th from upapada in
rasi  and  navamsa.  This  dasa  brought  her  marriage  as  well  as  divorce.  Guess  the
antardasa  that  may  have  brought  the  marriage  and  the  antardasa  that  may  have
brought the divorce.

24.5  Conclusion

Kalachakra  dasa  was  called  “the  most  respectable  dasa  of  all  dasas”  by  Parasara.
There  are  many  controversies  regarding  its  computation.  This  book  follows  the
approach  that  this  author  found  the  most  acceptable  based  on  his  study  of  “Brihat
Parasara Hora Sastram” and his practical researches. A significant percentage of this
author’s  successful  long-range  life-phase  predictions  were  made  using  Kalachakra
dasa68 and that is his favorite dasa.

68 And, a significant percentage his successful short-term predictions (focussing on a period of one or
two weeks) were made using Tajaka annual and monthly charts.

  308

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

When  we  learn  a  new  dasa,  the  first  question  we  should  ask  is  “when  should  it  be
applied and what results should be seen in it”. It is illogical to use 10 different dasas
interchangably.  Mixing  up  various  dasas  without  knowing  the  subtle  differences
between them results in vague explanations. An intelligent astrologer will realize that
different dasas are good at showing different kinds of events. Even when different
dasas  show  the  same  event,  they  show  it  from  different  angles  and  focus  on
different  aspects  of  the  same  event.  Without  appreciating  this,  one  cannot
understand why maharshis described tens, if not hundreds, of dasa systems.

Hence it is important to learn when a dasa can be applied and what kind of results it
shows.  Some  authors  suggested  that  Kalachakra  dasa  applies  only  when  Moon  is
stronger  in  navamsa  chart  than  in  rasi  chart.  However,  this  author  opines  that
Kalachakra  dasa  is  applicable  to  all  people,  as  Parasara  did  not  impose  any
conditions  on  its  applicability  and  went  to  the  extent  of  calling  it  “the  most
respectable dasa”.

Vimsottari dasa is based on the nakshatra of Moon. It throws light on the state of the
native’s  mind  as  time  progresses.  It  focusses  on  mind.  Narayana  dasa  shows  the
progress  of  lagna  in  one’s  life  and  it  shows  the  direction  taken  by  one’s  life.  The
focus is no longer on mind, but it is on the real happenings. Of course, one’s mental
state directly depends on the direction taken by one’s life and the real happenings in
one’s life.  In that sense,  Vimsottari dasa and Narayana dasa show the same events.
But the focus is different.

Kalachakra  dasa  depends  on  Moon’s  navamsa. Navamsa  shows  one’s  adherence  of
dharma or duty and throws light on the inner self. So the focus in Kalachakra dasa is
state  of  the  inner  self  and  the  sense  of  connectedness  in  one’s  mind.  It  shows  how
connected  one  is  with  respect  to  the  events  in  one’s  life.  For  example,  a  political
leader  may  be  running  D-10  Narayana  dasa  of  a  yogakaraka  rasi  and  he  may  land
political power. He may be running the Vimsottari dasa of Sun who may be exalted
in D-10 and so he may be feeling powerful. However, if Kalachakra dasa of a weak
and  afflicted  house  in  D-10  runs  at  the  same  time,  his  inner  self  may  not  feel
connected with the events in his career and he may feel a void. On the other hand, if
Kalachakra  dasa  rasi  is  strong  and  occupied  by  benefics  in  D-10,  then  one  may  be
successfully involved in activities that keep his inner self engaged.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

309

Narayana  dasa  specializes  in  showing  what  happens  in  one’s  life;  Vimsottari  dasa
specializes  in  showing  how  one’s  mind  views  what  happens  in  one’s  life;  and,
Kalachakra  dasa  specializes  in  showing  how  one  relates  to  what  happens  in  one’s
life and how connected one feels. These three are the most important of all general
purpose phalita dasas.

Different dasas do not provide different alternatives that can be used interchangeably
to  understand  what  happens  in  one’s  life,  but  they  provide  different  angles  –  or
vantage points – to view the same kaleidoscope that life is.

24.6  Answers to Exercises

Exercise 34:

Moon at 5Aq50 is in Dhanishtha 4th pada, which runs from 3Aq20 to 6Aq40. From
Table 47, we find that the 9 rasis associated with this nakshatra pada are: Sg, Sc, Li,
Vi, Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar.

The fraction of the pada traversed by Moon is (2º30')/( 3º20') = 150'/200' = 0.75. The
same fraction of paramayush (100 years) is 0.75 x 100 = 75 years. So 75 years out of
the 100 years were over before birth. We see from Table 52 that 68 years were over
by the end of Cn dasa and 7 years of Ge dasa added to it makes it 75 years. So Ge
dasa was running at birth and 9 – 7 = 2 years of Ge dasa were remaining at birth. By
adding 2 years to the birthdate, we get the date on which Ge dasa ends. Then we run
16  years of Ta dasa  and 7  years of Ar dasa. With Ar dasa, we finish the nine rasis
associated with the 4th pada of Dhanishtha (Apasavya-2). So we go to the 1st pada of
Apasavya-1 nakshatras (Table 46). The next 7 dasas will be Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi, Ar, Ta,
Ge. So we get the following calculations:

Ge dasa (02 years): 00-02 years of age
Ta dasa (16 years): 02-18 years of age

  310

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Ar dasa (07 years): 18-25 years of age
Sg dasa (10 years): 25-35 years of age
Cp dasa (04 years): 35-39 years of age
Aq dasa (04 years): 39-43 years of age
Pi dasa (10 years): 43-53 years of age
Ar dasa (07 years): 53-60 years of age
Ta dasa (16 years): 60-76 years of age
Ge dasa (09 years): 76-85 years of age

Exercise 35:

The 4th house is in Sg. A4 or the arudha pada of 4th house is in Vi. From Vi, Li is the
2nd house. Its lord Venus is in exalted in the 7th house and afflicts the debilitated 1st
lord (all from Vi). So Li is a strong maraka rasi from Vi. So Li-Li antardasa resulted
in the death of mother.

Exercise 36:

Let  us  take  navamsa.  Ge  contains  A7  in  navamsa  and  can  show  a  relationship.  It
contains the 3rd from UL (upapada lagna) and can show the start of a marriage. It is
the 7th house from Venus. It is the 4th house of harmony and bliss from lagna. Its lord
Mercury is exalted in the 7th house. Ge has 33 rekhas in SAV. For all these reasons,
Ge can be the antardasa. The 7th house Vi is also a candidate, but it is very weak with
only 22 rekhas in SAV.

For divorce, the 6th and 8th houses from lagna and the 2nd and 7th houses from UL are
good  candidates.  The  6th  and  8th  houses  from  lagna  bring  marital  troubles  and
quarrels. The 2nd and 7th houses from upapada bring the end of marriage. Here Li is
the  8th  house  from  lagna  and  the  7th  house  from  upapada.  It  is  the  7th  house  from
upapada in rasi also. In navamsa, it has 30 rekhas in SAV. While the 7th house has
only  22  rekhas,  the  8th  house  has  30  rekhas  and  so  the  8th  house  is  strong.  Evil
houses, when strong, only bring evil results.

Final Answer: The lady got married in Ge antardasa in Feb 1992 and got divorced in
Li antardasa in late 1995.

Exercise 37:

Ta dasa of about 13 years was left at birth. Then Ge dasa of 9 years, Le dasa 5 years
and Cn dasa of 21 years followed. Cn dasa ran during 1964-1984.

Part 2: Dasa Analysis

311

Cn  is  the  10th  from  lagna.  Its  lord  Moon  is  in  the  5th  from  lagna.  Moreover,  Cn
contains AL and shows status in career. Its strength is decided by SAV. SAV of D-
10 is shown below:

         Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi
Rekhas   24 28 21 38 34 21 26 26 37 31 25 26

In SAV, Cn has 38 rekhas. That is exceedingly strong. With the rasi containing AL
having 38 rekhas in SAV, the status of this actor must be high. He must be a well-
known  actor.  And,  Cn  dasa  must’ve  brought  excellent  results  and  increased  his
stature as an actor.

Final Answer: This chart belongs to Bill Cosby, one of the most gifted entertainers
that  the  US  television  industry  has  ever  seen.  He  had  a  successful  acting  career  in
films  too.  He  came  to  limelight  in  1965  with  a  lighthearted  adventure  TV  serial
called  “I  Spy”.  He  was  the  first  black  American  to  star  in  a  prime-time  television
drama series in US, and for his performances on the show he won the Emmy Award
for best actor in 1966, 1967, and 1968. The onset of Cn dasa brought him status.

Part 3:   Transit Analysis

The constant movement of planets in the skies is what is meant
by  the  word  “transits”  in  astrology.  Planets  keep  moving.  The
relationship between (1) the positions of planets at a given time
and  (2)  the  positions  of  planets  at  a  person’s  birthtime,  will
have a major impact on the kind of results that planets can give
the person at the time.

Position  of  planets  at  any  given  time  can  be  found  out  from
computer  programs/software  or  ephemeris  or  almanacs
(panchangas).  Judging  the  results  for  a  person  based on  those,
given the natal (birth) chart, is the subject of this part.

There  are  many  special  techniques  in  Vedic  astrology  for
interpreting transits. Some of those techniques are explained in
this part.

25.  Transits and Natal References

25.1  Introduction

By transits or gochaara, we mean the motion of planets in the skies. By the transit or
chaara or gochaara position of a planet, we mean the position occupied by a planet at
a given time. By the natal or radical or birth or janma position of a planet, we mean
the position occupied by a planet at the time of one’s birth.

By correlating the transit positions on a given day with the natal positions of several
reference  points,  we  can  draw  some  conclusions  about  the  nature  of  results
experienced  by  the  native  then.  Some  methods  normally  employed  in  such
correlation will be studied in this chapter.

25.2  Transits from Moon

The most popular natal reference in transit analysis is Moon. Moon is the significator
of mind and analysis of planetary positions with respect to Moon shows the mental
state.  Depending  on  the  houses  occupied  by  transit  planets  with  respect  to  natal
Moon, they exert different influences on one’s mental state. The transit of Vimsottari
dasa  lord  is  particularly  important,  because  he  is  the  one  who  has  the  greatest
influence on one’s mental state during a period.

The rasi occupied by Moon in the natal chart is called “janma rasi” and planets give
different  results  when  transiting  in  different  houses  from  janma  rasi.  The  standard
results given in literature are given in Table 53 – Table 59.

These  results  are  given  only  for  reference.  In  reality,  not  everyone  with  the  same
janma  rasi  experiences  the  same  results  on  a  given  day  (or  week  or  month).  The
results  given  by  planets  depend  on  what  they  stand  for  in  the  natal  chart.  For
example, if Mars is the 5th lord in a natal chart, then the worries given by him during
his transit in the 8th house from janma rasi may pertain to children. If Mars is the 10th
lord in natal chart, then the worries given by him during his transit in the 8th house
from janma rasi may pertain to career.

Chart 52

Part 3: Transit Analysis

319

Example 103: Suppose someone has Moon in Ge in natal chart. Let us analyze the
transits on June 7, 1999. The transit chart is shown in Chart 52.

Janma rasi is Ge. Transit Jupiter and Saturn are in Ar, the 11th house from janma rasi.
This  is  a  good  transit  and  shows  gains.  The  native  may  have  gains  in  the  matters
signified by the houses ruled and occupied by Jupiter and Saturn in natal rasi chart
and  natal  divisional  charts.  Because  Jupiter  signifies  children  and  tradition  and
Saturn  signifies  livelihood,  the  gains  may  also  be  related  to  children,  traditional
cermemonies, livelihood etc.

Transit  Sun  is  in  Ta,  the  12th  house  from  janma  rasi.  That  gives  expenditure  and
losses.  One  may  have  losses  in  the  matters  signified  by  the  houses  ruled  and
occupied by Sun. Because Sun signifies authorities and health, it may also be related
to those.

Mercury  is  in  janma  rasi  (Ge).  This  suggests  “quarrels,  imprisonment,  losses,  poor
advice”.  However,  Mercury  is  strong  being  in  own  house  (intellectual  Gemini).  So
the results may be intellectual debates and arguments.

In  this  manner,  we  can  analyze  transits  of  all  the  planets.  We  can  use  the  results
given  in  literature,  but  we  should  adapt  them  intelligently  to  the  chart  at  hand.  We
should understand what each planet stands for in a chart.

In  addition,  there  are  natal  references  other  than  Moon,  though  Moon  is  the  most
important natal reference when interpreting transits.

25.3  Other Natal References

We can analyze transits with respect to lagna and paaka lagna. Lagna is the hub of
vitality  and  one’s  personality  in  a  chart.  Using  the  ashtakavarga  tables,  we  can
decipher whether the transit of a planet in a house from lagna is favorable or not. We
can see which house a planet is transiting in, with respect to natal lagna, and expect
the planet to influence the matters of that house. The influence  exerted by  a transit
planet  on  the  house  occupied  by  it  depends  on  its  inherent  nature  and  its
significations  in  the  natal  chart.  For  example,  Jupiter  transiting  in  the  Ta  may  give
marriage to someone born in Sc lagna, because Ta is the 7th house from Sc. Saturn

  320

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

transiting  in  Ar  may  give  relationship  problems  or  marital  problems  for  someone
born in Li lagna, because Ar is the 7th house from Li.

We  can  also  look  at  the  aspects  cast  by  transiting  planets.  Suppose  Jupiter  is
transiting in Vi and someone has lagna in Sc. Jupiter aspects Ta, the 7th house from
Sc, when he is in Vi. So Jupiter can give marriage during his Vi transit also. We can
look at the aspects cast by transiting planets on the rasis containing the natal houses
and  the  natal  planets.  Suppose  someone  has  lagna  in  Sc  and  Venus  in  Pi  in  natal
chart.  Then  the  7th  house  is  in  Ta  and  Venus,  the  significator  of  marriage,  is  in  Pi.
Jupiter transiting in Vi aspects both Ta and Pi and hence he may give marriage.

Thus we should look at the rasis occupied and aspected by planets in their transit and
find  out  which  houses  and  planets  occupy  those  rasis  in  the  natal  chart.  Based  on
that,  we  should  guess  the  results  given  by  the  planets.  A  planet  occupying  or
aspecting  a  rasi  in  transit  influences  the  matters  signified  by  the  houses  and
planets stationed in that rasi in the natal chart. The exact nature of the influence
exerted by a planet depends on its inherent nature and the matters it stands for in the
natal chart. For example, if the 5th lord in the natal chart is occupying the 8th house
from  natal  lagna  in  transit,  some  troubles  related  to  children  may  be  expected.  If
Mars  is  the  8th  lord  in  the  natal  chart  and  aspects,  in  transit,  the  rasis  occupied  by
Venus and 7th lord in the natal chart, then some disturbances in marital life may be
expected.

Sahams are useful in transit analysis. Sahams are the significant points in the zodiac.
For example, when the 7th lord or Venus transits close to vivaha saham, one may get
married. When the 6th lord or 8th lord or Mars or Rahu transits close to kali saham,
one may have an accident.

A  malefic  planet  transiting  in  janma  rasi  may  give  mental  worries  and  a  malefic
planet  transiting  in  natal  lagna  may  affect  the  vitality  of  the  native  and  create
obstacles  in  his  efforts.  On  the  other  hand,  paaka  lagna  explicitly  stands  for  the
physical  self  and  a  malefic  planet  transiting  in  paaka  lagna  may  give  bodily
complaints.  Similarly  planets  occupying  or  aspecting  arudha  padas  in  transit  may
give  relevant  results.  For  example,  Saturn’s  transit  in  A10  can  be  bad  for  career,
Jupiter’s transit in A9 is good for fortune and so on.

Example  104:  Let  us  consider  the  natal  chart  of  a  lady  and  the  transit  chart  at  the
time of her wedding (see Chart 53).

Part 3: Transit Analysis

321

Chart 53

The  7th  house  in  the  natal  chart  is  in  Vi. Mercury  is  the  7th  lord  and  he  is  in  Cn  in
natal  chart.  Venus  is  the  significator  of  marriage  and  he  is  in  Le  in  the  natal  chart.

  322

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Vivaha  saham  is  at  1º  in  Cp  in  the  natal  chart.  If  important  planets  influence  these
reference points in transit, they can give marriage.

Jupiter  is  a  natural  benefic  and  also  lagna  lord  here.  His  transit  is  important  for
timing auspicious events. On the day of wedding, Jupiter occupied Pi, aspecting Vi
(natal 7th house) and Cn (has natal 7th lord). Natal 7th lord Mercury occupied Cp in
transit and aspected Cn,  rasi occupied by him in the natal chart.  In addition, transit
Mercury was stationed about 1º away from natal vivaha saham. Venus also aspected
his natal position in transit.

25.4  Transits and Divisional Charts

Though the motivation for the approach described here comes from some principles
described  in  classics,  the  actual  approach  is  essentially  based  on  this  author’s  own
researches.  This  author  heard  about  “Bhrigu  transits”,  which  correlate  the  transit
positions  in  navamsa  chart  with  the  natal  positions  in  rasi  chart.  However,  he  does
not know much about the tradition of Bhrigu transits to conclude whether or not his
findings are loosely related to that tradition.

Though this author prefers to teach only those approaches that have the sanction of
maharshis,  he  finds  this  particular  approach  superior  to  most  other  techniques  of
transit  analysis.  Moreover,  this  approach  does  not  violate  any  teachings  of
maharshis. This is also a fertile area for research and deserves our attention. Hence it
will be covered here. However, readers are advised to keep in mind that what follows
is a product of the very limited intelligence of this author and hence prone to errors.
Readers are encouraged to question and to conduct further researches in this area.

We said that a planet occupying or aspecting a rasi in transit influences the matters
signified  by  the  houses  and  planets  stationed  in  that  rasi  in  the  natal  chart.  For
example, we said that Jupiter transiting over Venus69 may give marriage. However,
we know that navamsa is the chart that shows marriage. So, is there any significance
for Jupiter’s rasi chart transit over the navamsa of Venus? In other words, if Venus is
in Cancer in navamsa, can Jupiter transiting in Cancer in rasi chart bring marriage?

69  We  say  that  “Jupiter  transits  over  Venus”,  if  Jupiter,  in  his  transit,  occupies  the  rasi  occupied  by
Venus in the natal chart.

Part 3: Transit Analysis

323

We  do  not  have  different  zodiacs  for  different  divisional  charts.  All  the  divisional
charts use the same zodiac. So Cancer in natal navamsa chart and Cancer in transit
rasi chart are not different. They are one and the same. If Jupiter transiting in Cancer
can  influence  the  house  and  planets  stationed  in  Cancer  in  rasi  chart,  he  should  be
able to influence the house and planets stationed in Cancer in navamsa chart too! We
can extend this logic to all the divisional charts.

Rasi chart shows everything that exists at the physical level. Divisional charts show
various areas of life. The interaction between the two decides how events in various
areas of life materialize at the physical level. Natal chart shows the innate potential.
Transit  chart  shows  the  temporary  influences.  The  interaction  between  the  two
decides  how  temporary  influences  convert  innate  potential  into  actions  and  life
events.

So the most important interactions are those between

(1) a natal divisional chart and the transit rasi chart, and,
(2) the natal rasi chart and a transit divisional chart.

Here  (1)  shows  how  innate  potential  in  a  particular  area  of  life  is  influenced  at  a
given time to result in action at the physical level. This helps us in coarse timing of
events.  We  can  fine-tune  the  timing  of  events  with  (2),  which  shows  how  the
potential at the physical level is transformed into an event in a particular area of life.

Example  105:  Let  us  consider  the  natal  navamsa  chart  of  a  male  engineer  and  the
transit rasi chart at the time of his wedding (see Chart 54).

In  natal  navamsa,  Pi  contains  the  7th  house  and  its  lord  Jupiter  is  in  Aq.  When  we
look at navamsa, we should look at the 9th lord. The 9th lord in navamsa shows the
dharma  followed.  In  Hindu  life,  the  marriage  ceremony  is  an  act  of  dharma.  Here
Venus  shows  dharma.  So  Venusian  influence  over  the  7th  house  shows  getting
married.  In  the  transit  rasi  chart  of  wedding,  Venus  occupies  Aq,  which  is  7th  lord
Jupiter’s natal navamsa position.

  324

Part 3: Transit Analysis

325

Jupiter is in own sign in Pi in transit, which is the 7th house in natal navamsa. Moon
owns the 11th house in natal navamsa and he shows gains in the matters of dharma
and marriage. He is in Aries in the transit Rasi chart and Aries contains upapada in
the natal navamsa chart. This shows the fructification, at the physical level, of gains
in  dharma  due  to  marriage.  Lagna  lord  Mercury  is  in  Cp  in  the  natal  navamsa,
showing dharmik self. In transit rasi chart also, Mercury occupies the same house.

The key points will be summarized again:

(1) Jupiter  is  in  Pi  in  transit  rasi  chart  and  aspects  Vi.  Lagna  is  in  Vi  and  the  7th

house is in Pi in the natal navamsa chart.

(2) Venus  is  the  significator  of  marriage  and  the  lord  of  the  9th  house  (dharma)  in
natal navamsa. He is in Aq in the transit rasi chart. The 7th lord Jupiter occupies
Aq in the natal navamsa chart.

(3) Mercury is the lord of lagna and occupies Cp, in the natal navamsa chart. He is in

Cp in the transit rasi chart also.

Example 106: Let us consider the natal D-7 chart of a gentleman and the transit rasi
chart at the time of the birth of his daughter (see Chart 55).

D-7 shows children and happiness from them. The 5th house shows children. It is Vi
here. Jupiter, the significator of children, and exalted Mercury occupy it. It may be
noticed that both Jupiter and Mercury are in Vi at the time of child-birth. So 5th lord
in D-7 and significator of children  activated the  5th house of D-7 in their rasi chart
transit and that gave a child.

Example  107:  Let  us  consider  the  death  of  John  F.  Kennedy,  Jr.  Natal  D-11  and
transit rasi charts are given in Chart 56. Natal rasi chart and transit D-11 charts are
given in Chart 57.

D-11 or Rudramsa is the chart that shows death and destruction. Considering that the
native had a violent death in a plane crash, D-11 is the apt chart to see his death.

In rasi chart, the 3rd house from AL shows the place and nature of death. It must have
the aspect of a cruel planet for a violent death. Here the 3rd house from AL is in Cp, a
watery sign. It is aspected by Rahu from Le and a violent death in water is possible.

Now, we must analyze D-11 carefully for a violent death. Natal D-11 has lagna in Ge
and Rahu occupies it. That is consistent with a violent death. The 2nd house in Cn is
strong with its lord Moon occupying it. Sun is the 3rd lord – which shows physical
vitality  –  and  he  joins  the  house  of  death,  7th,  with  7th  lord  Jupiter.  Mercury  owns
lagna and he is in 12th. This D-11 chart has unfavorable features. Now let us look at
the houses occupied in transit rasi chart, with respect to this D-11, by the planets of
life  –  Mercury  (1st  lord),  Sun  (3rd  lord)  and  Saturn  (8th  lord)  –  and  the  planets  of
death – Jupiter (7th lord) and Moon (2nd lord) and Rahu (a malefic in lagna).

Two  planets  of  life,  Mercury  and  Sun,  are  in  Cn,  afflicted  by  Rahu.  Cn  is  the  2nd
house and stands for death in the natal D-11. Planet of death Moon is in Le (a house
of life from natal D-11 lagna) and Jupiter aspects him, as well as his own 7th house
(Sg). Saturn is debilitated. On the whole, the houses and planets of life in D-11 are
afflicted or weak in the transit rasi chart.

Now  let  us  look  at  the  interaction  between  the  natal  rasi  chart  and  the  transit  D-11
(Chart 57). In rasi chart, Le is lagna and Sun is lagna lord. Le represents the native,
Cp represents his accidents, Sun represents the physical body and Aq (7th) and Saturn
(7th lord) represent death. Jupiter (8th lord) represents longevity.

The natal rasi chart shows the existence of the native at the physical level. The transit
D-11 represents the momentary forces of destruction and let us study its interaction
with the natal rasi chart.

In transit D-11, Le is afflicted by Rahu and 12th lord Moon. Jupiter, who represents
longevity is in the 12th house. Sun, who represents the physical body in the natal rasi
chart, is in the 6th house of accidents in transit D-11 with exalted Mars, significator
of accidents. The 7th lord in natal rasi chart, Saturn, represents the end of the native’s
life and he is in Sc in transit D-11, the same sign that contains lagna lord in the natal
rasi  chart.  So  the  killer  of  the  natal  rasi  chart  (Saturn)  interacts  with  the  physical
body (Sun) in the chart showing momentary forces of destruction (transit D-11).

Exercise 38: For a native born on 4th April 1970 at 5:50 pm (IST) at Machilipatnam,
India  (81e12,  16n15),  an  important  event  related  to  D-4  happened  on  16th  August
1991.  Try  to  guess  it  based  on  the  interaction  between  natal  D-4  and  transit  rasi
chart. Then analyze the interaction between natal rasi chart and transit D-4 also.

Exercise  39:  The  native  of  Exercise  38  had  an  important  event  related  to  D-24  on
April 17, 1998. Try to guess it based on the interaction between the natal D-24 chart
and the transit rasi chart.

25.5  Transits and Ashtakavarga

Though one of the purposes of ashtakavarga is to assess the strength of planets and
houses in natal charts, its most important purpose is the interpretation of transits. Just
as we look at the house occupied by a transit planet with respect to natal Moon and
natal lagna, we can look at the houses occupied by a transit planet with respect to all
the eight references used in ashtakavarga.

If a planet is benefic in its transit rasi with respect to 5 or more natal references, out
of eight, then it will produce good results. If a planet is benefic in its transit rasi with
respect to 3 or less natal references, out of eight, then it will produce bad results. Of
course,  the  exact  nature  of  the  good  or  bad  results  given  by  a  planet  depend  on  its
natural significations and its significations in the natal chart.

To  see  this,  we  look  at  the  number  of  rekhas  in  the  transit  rasi  in  the  transiting
planet’s BAV. If, for example, Saturn’s BAV of the natal rasi chart has 5 rekhas in
Ta, then that means that Saturn is benefic with respect to 5 out of 8 natal references
in Ta. So he produces good results when he transits Taurus. The same logic can be
extended  to  the  divisional  charts.  If  Jupiter  has  8  rekhas  in  Ar  in  natal  D-10  chart,
then his transit in Aries in rasi chart invariably brings excellent results in career. The
matters that benefit depend on Jupiter’s placement and ownership in the natal D-10
chart.  Basically,  Jupiter’s  rasi  transit  in  Aries  activates  the  manifestation  of  Jovian
energy at the physical level in Aries. If Jupiter has many rekhas in his D-10 BAV, it
shows that Jovian energy in Aries goes well with most sources of energy in D-10 and
thus it can have a significant impact on a native’s career.

A planet with 6 or 7 rekhas in its transit rasi in its BAV invariably brings excellent
results.  A  planet  with  1  or  0  rekhas  in  its  transit  rasi  in  its  BAV  invariably  brings
very poor results.

25.5.1  Samudaaya Ashtakavarga

Part 3: Transit Analysis

331

In  addition  to  looking  at  the  transit  planet’s  natal  BAV,  we  should  also  look  at  the
natal  SAV  –  Samudaaya  Ashtakavarga.  If,  for  example,  SAV  has  40  bindus  in
Pisces,  then  it  means  that  Pisces  is  very  strong  in  the  chart.  Planets  transiting  in
Pisces, tend to give good results irrespective of their strength. Of course, if a planet
with 6 rekhas in Pi in its own BAV and a planet with 2 rekhas in Pi in its own BAV
are transiting Pi, the former planet will produce better results than the latter planet.
Rekhas in the individual BAVs of planets also matter, but SAV will dominate over
the BAVs if it has too many or too few rekhas.

Planets transiting in rasis with more than 30 rekhas in SAV usually bring favorable
results.  Planets  transiting  in  rasis  with  less  than  25  rekhas  in  SAV  usually  bring
unfavorable results.

Chart 58

Example  108:  Let  us  consider  the  D-10  chart  of  Sri  A.B.  Vajpayee,  India’s  Prime
Minister (see Chart 58). His D-10 ashtakavarga is given below:

        Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

SAV     23 26 33 20 28 33 26 35 28 31 24 30

He became India’s Prime Minister on March 19, 1998 (see Chart 59).

Chart 59

Sun, Mars, Mercury and Saturn are all in Pi and Pi has 30 rekhas in SAV. None of
them  is  too  weak  in  individual  BAV.  Venus  is  GL  lord  in  natal  D-10  and  he  is  an
important planet for power and authority. In the transit chart, he is in Cp. Cp has 31
rekhas  and  Venus  has  6  rekhas.  Moon  is  in  Sc  with  35  rekhas.  Jupiter  is  in  Aq.
Though  Aq  is  not  strong  in  SAV,  it  is  strong  in  Jupiter’s  BAV.  It  has  7  rekhas  in
Jupiter’s  natal  D-10  BAV.  Jupiter’s  strength  is  important,  as  he  is  the  Vimsottari
dasa lord.

Part 3: Transit Analysis

333

So 6 out of 7 planets are in rasis that are very strong in D-10 SAV. And the 7th planet
is extremely strong in its BAV. Vimsottari dasa lord and natal GL lord have 7 and 6
rekhas respectively.

So,  as  per  ashtakavarga,  transits  are  very  favorable  to  Sri  Vajpayee’s  career  on
March 19, 1998.

Exercise 40: Consider the D-10 chart of a gentleman and the transit rasi chart during
a crucial week in his life, given in Chart 60. What are the prospects for his career at
the time of the transit? Do you expect good results or setbacks?

25.5.2  Kakshyas and Prastaara Ashtakavarga

Each  rasi  is  divided  into  eight  kakshyas  of  3º  45'  each.  Kakshya  literally  means
“orbit”. When a planet is in Saturn’s kakshya, its placement with respect to Saturn is
the most important. When a planet is in Jupiter’s kakshya, its placement with respect
to Jupiter is the most important. The first kakshya in each rasi starts from 0º in that
rasi  and  ends  at  3º  45'.  Saturn  is  the  ruler  of  the  first  kakshya.  The  start  and  end
points and the lords of all the eight kakshyas are given in Table 60.

Example 109: Let us say Mercury is at 16º in Cn, Jupiter is it 24º in Vi and Venus is
at  4º  in  Sc.  Because  16º  is  between  15º  and  18º  45',  Mercury  is  in  the  kakshya  of

Part 3: Transit Analysis

335

Venus.  Because  24º  is  between  22º  30'  and  26º  15',  Jupiter  is  in  the  kakshya  of
Moon. Because 4º is between 3º 45' and 7º 30', Venus is in the kakshya of Jupiter.

In the above example, Venus is in the kakshya of Jupiter and hence the placement of
Venus  with  respect  to  Jupiter  is  more  important  than  his  placement  with  respect  to
other planets. Suppose the BAV of Venus has 5 rekhas in Sc. Then Venus is benefic
in  Sc  with  respect  to  5  out  of  8  references  and  that  is  favorable.  However,  when
Venus is at 4º in Sc, he is in Jupiter’s kakshya and what matters the most is whether
Venus  is  benefic  in  Sc  with  respect  to  Jupiter  or  not.  If  Jupiter  is  not  one  of  the  5
references from which Venus is benefic in Sc, then Venusian transit between 3º 45'
and 7º 30' in Sc will not be favorable.

To  find  out  whether  Venus  is  benefic  with  respect  to  Jupiter  in  Sc  or  not,  we  can
look at the Prastaara Ashtakavarga (PAV) of Venus. If we find that Venus is benefic
with  respect  to  Jupiter  in  Sc,  we  say  that  the  PAV  of  Venus  has  a  rekha  in  the
kakshya of Jupiter in Sc. Each rasi has eight kakshyas and a kakshya has a rekha in a
planet’s PAV if that planet is benefic in that rasi with respect to the kakshya lord.

A  popular  method  of  delineating  favorable  and  unfavorable  days  is  to  look  at  the
number of planets that are in a kakshya with a rekha. If too many or too few planets
are  in  a  kakshya  with  a  rekha,  favorable  or  unfavorable  results  may  be  expected
(respectively).  However,  one  should  not  use  this  principle  in  vacuum.  It  should  be
used  only  in  conjunction  with  dasas,  Tajaka  charts  and  other  transit  analysis
techniques. This principle can only be used to fine-tune a prediction to a few days.

Example  110:  Let  us  consider  Indira  Gandhi’s  assassination.  Her  chart  and  the
transit chart at the time of her assassination is given in Chart 61.

Sun  is  at  14  Li  24.  Because  14º  24'  is  between  11º  15'  and  15º,  he  is  in  his  own
kakshya. Sun’s PAV does not have a rekha in Sun’s kakshya in Li. Sun is benefic in
Li  only  with  respect  to  lagna,  Moon,  Mercury,  Jupiter  and  Saturn.  So  only  the
corresponding kakshyas in Li have a rekha in Sun’s BAV.

It can be seen that Sun is in Sun’s kakshya, Moon in Sun’s kakshya, Mars in Moon’s
kakshya,  Mercury  in  lagna’s  kakshya,  Jupiter  in  Venus’s  kakshya,  Venus  in
Mercury’s kakshya and Saturn in Moon’s kakshya. Only Moon and Mercury are in
kakshyas with rekhas.

  336

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 61

Part 3: Transit Analysis

337

With 5 out of 7 planets transiting in kakshyas without rekhas, including  Vimsottari
dasa lord Saturn, it is not a favorable time for Mrs. Gandhi.

Again it must be emphasized that this technique can only be used in conjunction with
other  techniques  and  readers  should  not  rush  to  predictions  just  based  on  this
principle.

25.6  Timing with Sodhya Pindas

Parasara  taught  some  techniques  of  timing  events  based  on  sodhya  pindas.  We  can
take the number of rekhas in any house from a planet and multiply the count with the
planet’s sodhya pinda. We can get a nakshatra from that product by dividing it with
27,  taking  the  remainder  and  counting  nakshatras  from  Aswini.  Benefics  and
malefics  transiting  in  the  nakshatra  will  give  good  or  bad  results  (respectively)
relating to the original house. Especially Saturn’s transit is important. Saturn’s transit
in  the  nakshatra  corresponding  to  a  particular  house  makes  the  signified  matters
suffer. Jupiter’s transit is beneficial. Some people also take the 10th or 19th nakshatra
from the nakshtra found above. A nakshatra and the 10th and 19th nakshatras from it
are owned by the same planet under Vimsottari dasa scheme and they go together.

We can also find a rasi by dividing the product with 12 instead of 27 and counting
rasis from Aries. Saturn’s transit in the resultant rasi brings misfortune relating to the
original house. However, nakshatras are more important.

When we find houses from Sun, we should look at matters related to soul, inherent
nature, personality, will power and father. Houses from Moon show mind, wisdom,
peace,  happiness  and  mother.  Houses  from  Mars  show  siblings,  land  and  strength.
Houses  from  Mercury  stress  on  business,  commerce,  profession,  friends  and  good
behavior. Houses from Jupiter show the nourishment of body, learning, children and
wealth. Houses from Venus show marriage, comforts, luxuries, vehicles and sexual
pleasures. Saturn shows longevity, livelihood, fears, sadness, dangers and sorrows.

When we want to time events relating to a particular matter, we should first fix the
relevant  planet.  Then  we  should  fix  the  relevant  house.  We  should  then  find  the
number  of  rekhas  in  that  house  from  that  planet  in  that  planet’s  BAV.  We  should
multiply  it  by  the  sodhya  pinda  of  the  planet  (also  called  yoga  pinda).  By  dividing
the  product  with  27  or  12  and  taking  the  remainder,  we  should  find  the  associated

  338

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

nakshatra or rasi. Then we can time key events based on the transits in that nakshatra
and rasi.

For example, suppose we want to time the good and bad periods of a native’s father.
Father should be seen from Sun and the 9th house. We can take Sun’s BAV and find
the  number  of  rekhas  in  the  9th  house  from  Sun.  Suppose  Sun  is  in  Aq.  Suppose
Sun’s BAV contains 5 rekhas in Li (the 9th from Aq). Suppose Sun’s sodhya pinda is
86. Multiplying 86 with 5, we get 430. If we divide 430 by 27, the quotient is 15 and
the remainder is 25. The 25th constellation is Poorvabhadrapada. So Saturn’s transit
in Poorvabhadrapada is  bad for  father  and Jupiter’s transit in the same nakshatra is
good. Now let us find the rasi. By dividing 430 by 12, we get a quotient of 35 and a
remainder  of  10.  So  Saturn’s  transit  in  Cp  (the  10th  rasi  of  the  zodiac)  is  bad  for
father and Jupiter’s transit in Cp is good.

Though  Parasara  indicated  that  we  can  take  any  house  from  any  planet  and  gave  a
long list of matters to be seen from each planet, he gave a few specific examples. A
list of the matters is given in Table 61.

Some examples will be given now. However, this approach does not give consistent
results.  Readers  should  realize  that  the  topic  of  sodhya  pindas  is  open  to  research.
Most  astrologers  use  these  principles  with  only  the  rasi  chart.  If  matters  relating  to
father have to be seen from D-12, as taught by Parasara, should we use D-12 when
timing  events  related  to  father?  Should  we  use  the  sodhya  pinda  and  rekha  count
from  D-12?  Should  we  take  the  9th  from  Sun  in  rasi  chart  or  take  it  in  D-12?  All
these  are  issues  that  need  to  be  researched.  Moreover,  as  we  have  learnt,  there  are
some  inconsistencies  between  Parasara  and  Varahamihira  in  the  definition  of
ashtakavarga and this can alter the sodhya pindas of Moon and Venus.  In addition,

Part 3: Transit Analysis

339

we have some controversies in the exact definitions of the reductions to be done to
get  Sodhita  Ashtakavarga  from  Bhinna  Ashtakavarga.  That  can  again  alter  sodhya
pindas. Timing of events with sodhya pindas is a very important topic, but what the
readers learn here may not be the final word. It is hoped that readers will experiment
with an open mind and share their findings with other astrologers.

Example 111: Let us consider Princess Diana, who died in a fatal automobile crash
when Saturn was in Revathi star (Pisces). Her rasi chart is given in Chart 62.

Chart 62

To see longevity, we should use the 8th house from Saturn and Saturn’s BAV. The 8th
house from Saturn is Le.

               Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

Saturn’s BAV    3  4  6  3  0  2  2  5  4  3  2  5

  340

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Le has 0 rekhas in Saturn’s BAV. Saturn’s sodhya pinda is 203. The product is 0. By
dividing it with 27, we get 0 which is equivalent to 27. So we get Revathi star. By
dividing 0 with 12, we get 0 which is equivalent to 12. So we get Pisces.

When Saturn was transiting in Revathi star in Pisces, she passed away.

Example 112: Let us look at the rasi chart of software tycoon Bill Gates (see Chart
24).  Despite  Jupiter’s  simultaneous  transit,  Saturn’s  transit  in  Krittika  star  brought
some troubles. In a landmark ruling in June 2000, a US judge ruled that his company
–  software  giant  Microsoft  Corporation  –  was  a  monopoly  and  ordered  a  breakup
into two smaller companies.

Moon’s BAV is shown below:

             Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

Moon’s BAV    4  3  4  4  6  3  1  5  5  4  4  6

Moon is in Pisces and Pisces has 6 rekhas. Moon’s sodhya pinda is 122. The product
of  122  and  6  is  732.  By  dividing  732  with  27,  we  get  a  quotient  of  27  and  a
remainder of 3. The 3rd star is Krittika (26 Ar 40 – 10 Ta 00). So Saturn’s transit in
Krittika star can attack the 1st house from Moon – the mental state and happiness.

Saturn  shows  sorrows,  suffering  and  fears.  The  6th  house  shows  litigation.  The  6th
from  Saturn  can  be  used  for  sorrows  and  setbacks  in  litigation.  Saturn’s  BAV  is
shown below:

               Ar Ta Ge Cn Le Vi Li Sc Sg Cp Aq Pi

Saturn’s BAV    3  3  4  4  7  2  1  3  2  4  3  3

Here the 6th house from Saturn is Pi and it has 3 rekhas in Saturn’s BAV. Saturn’s
sodhya pinda is 145. The product of 145 and 3 is 435. By dividing 435 with 27, we
get a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 3. That again shows Krittika star. So Saturn’s
transit in Krittika star can bring sadness and setbacks related to litigation.

As a result, he suffered an unfavorable ruling from a US judge.

25.7  Conclusion

Transit positions of planets are the positions occupied by them at a given time. Natal
positions  of  planets  are  the  positions  occupied  by  them  at  the  time  of  one’s  birth.
Natal  positions  stand  for  the  innate  potential  of  a  nativity  and  the  transit  positions
show  the  temporary  influences  –  planetary  pulls  and  pushes.  If  their  interaction  is
studied, some insight can be gained on the kind of results that are experienced at a
given time. It is suggested that the interaction between the natal divisional charts and
the transit rasi chart helps in coarse timing of events and the interaction between the
natal  rasi  chart  and  transit  divisional  charts  helps  in  fine  timing  of  events.  Some
techniques based on ashtakavarga, kakshyas and sodhya pindas are also given in this
chapter.

25.8  Answer to the Exercises

Exercise 38:

Natal D-4 chart and transit rasi chart are given in Chart 63. Lagna is in Sg in natal D-
4.  The  9th  house  of  fortune  in  a  foreign  land  is  in  Le  and  it  contains  Rahu,  the
significator of foreign things. So Le stands for life in a foreign land in this D-4. Four
planets  occupy  it  in  the  transit  rasi  chart,  including  Jupiter,  Mercury  and  Mars.
Jupiter  owns  lagna  in  natal  D-4  and  he  shows  the  native  from  the  point of  view  of
residence  and  fortune.  Mercury  owns  lagna  in  natal  rasi  chart  and  he  shows  the
physical  self  of  the  native.  Mars  owns  the  12th  house  in  natal  D-4  and  he  shows
living  in  distant  places.  All  these  planets  activate  Le  in  their  rasi  chart  transit.  So
foreign journey is a possibility. In addition, Rahu is in Sg in the transit rasi chart and
Sg contains lagna in natal D-4. So foreign influence on residence is fortified.

Natal rasi chart and transit D-4 chart are  given in Chart 64.  Lagna in Vi shows the
nativity.  Rahu  in  Vi  in  transit  D-4  shows  foreign  influence  on  Vi  in  the  matter  of
residence.  Since  Vi  represents  the  nativity  in  natal  lagna,  this  D-4  transit  supports
going abroad.

Chart 64

The  7th  lord  in  the  natal  rasi  chart  is  Jupiter  and  he  is  in  Le  in  D-4.  Le  is  the  12th
house in the natal rasi chart. This shows a long trip. Aries (8th house) and Mars (8th
lord) show changes in the natal rasi chart. Taurus (9th house) shows flourishing in a
foreign land. Aries contains two malefics and Mars occupies Taurus, in transit D-4.

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

This  shows  the  changes  in  residence  and  the  temporary  troubles  of  adjusting  to  a
foreign  land.  Interaction  between  the  natal  rasi  chart  and  transit  divisional  charts
shows finer and momentary details.

Final Answer: The native left his motherland and landed in USA on that date.

Exercise 39:

See Chart 65. The rasi transits that stand out are: (1) benefics Jupiter and Venus in
Aq with Ketu and (2) three malefics in Ar, with two of them being very strong.

Ar has the 11th house in natal D-24 and shows gains. It also contains Guru pada (A9
– arudha pada of the 9th house). Its lord Mars and exalted Sun occupy it in the transit
rasi  chart  and  that  can  show  gains  in  the  area  of  life  represented  by  D-24,  i.e.
knowledge  and  learning.  With  A9  in  D-24  activated  by  rasi  transits,  some
developments related to guru are also possible.

Now look at Jupiter and Venus. They are in Aq in the transit rasi chart. What does
Aq stand for in the natal D-24? It is the 9th house and it shows one’s teacher. Transit
of Jupiter and Venus in it can show coming under the influence of a guru.

Final Answer: The native was accepted as a sishya (disciple) by a Jyotish guru on the
given date.

Exercise 40:

Sun, Mercury and Saturn have 6, 6 and 5 rekhas (respectively) in Libra in their D-10
BAV’s.  So  their  Libra  transit  is  good  for  D-10  related  matters.  SAV  contains  36
rekhas in Libra and that adds to it. Jupiter is also strong with 6 rekhas in Sg in his D-
10.  A  few  planets  are  very  well-placed.  Saturn  is  exalted  in  natal  D-10  and  he  is
exalted in transit chart also. On the whole, transits look very good.

Final Answer: This D-10 belongs to Rajiv Gandhi, assassinated former PM of India.
The transit chart belongs to the time when he became the Prime Minister of India.

26.  Transits: Miscellaneous Topics

26.1  Introduction

In  the  chapter  “Transits  and  Natal  References”,  we  concentrated  on  correlating  the
natal chart and the transit chart using the rasis occupied by planets in both. There are
some  principles  about  rasi  transits  that  we  haven’t  yet  covered.  We  will  cover  a
couple of concepts in this chapter.

Nakshatras are also an important division of the zodiac and they are as important as
rasis.  By  looking  at  the  interactions  between  the  nakshatras  occupied  by  planets  in
the natal and transit charts, we can make some predictions about the results given by
them at the time of the transit. We will look at a few principles.

26.2  Murthis (Forms/Idols)

To  judge  the  results  given  by  a  planet  during  its  transit  in  a  particular  rasi,  find
exactly when the planet enters the rasi. Find the house occupied by transit Moon at
that  time  with  respect  to  his  own  (Moon’s)  natal  position.  Based  on  the  house,  we
say that the planet is a golden or silver or copper or iron form during its transit in the
rasi. The list of houses and murthis is given in Table 62.

Table 62: Murthis

Let  us  take  Mercury’s  transit  in  Gemini  during  May  26,  2000  –  Aug  3,  2000.
Mercury entered Gemini at 3:06 pm (IST) on May 26, 2000. At that time, Moon was
at 10º 29' in Aquarius. We should find which house Aquarius is with respect to natal

Part 3: Transit Analysis

347

Moon and then refer to Table 62 to find out which murthi Mercury is for a particular
person during May 26-Aug 3, 2000.

Suppose someone has natal Moon in Aquarius. Then Moon at the time of Mercury’s
rasi entry is in the 1st house from natal Moon. So Mercury is a swarna murthi (golden
form)  for  that  person  during  his  Ge  transit  and  will  give  full  results.  Suppose
someone  has  natal  Moon  in  Pisces  (e.g.  Bill  Gates,  whose  chart  was  considered
earlier).  Aquarius  is  the  12th  house  from  Pisces.  So  Mercury  is  a  loha  murthi  (iron
form)  during  his  Ge  transit.  That  is  highly  unfavorable.  Even  if  it  is  a  favorable
transit otherwise, Mercury may not give his full results. If it is an unfavorable transit
otherwise, then Mercury will make the native suffer much.

26.3  Rasi Gochara Vedha

We  listed  the  good  and  bad  houses  for  all  planets  to  transit  from  natal  Moon  in  a
previous  chapter.  Even  when  a  planet  is  transiting  in  a  favorable  house  from  natal
Moon, it may be “obstructed” by another planet transiting in the vedha sthana (house
of  obstruction).  In  that  case,  the  planet  cannot  give  its  good  results.  The  vedha
sthaanas of all good transits of all planets are listed in Table 63.

Let us take Bill Gates, who has natal Moon in Pisces. Natal lagna and arudha lagna
lord Mercury transits in  Gemini during June 2000. As Mercury transiting in the 4th
house from natal Moon is auspicious, this transit should bring good results. We can
find the vedha sthaana for the 4th house transit of Mercury from the above table. It is
the  3rd  house.  If  there  are  planets  in  Taurus,  the  3rd  house  from  Pisces,  then  they

  348

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

cause vedha (obstruction) on Mercury. There were several planets causing vedha on
Mercury on June 8, 2000, when the company of Mr. Gates received a legal setback.
With  vedha  from  many  planets,  Mercury  cannot  give  his  good  results.  Moreover,
Mercury is a loha murthi as we discussed earlier.

This is how one should use the above table. Only exceptions are the father and son
pairs:

(1)  Sun and Saturn do not cause vedha on each other.

(2)  Moon and Mercury do not cause vedha on each other.

It is important to consider vedhas and murthis to understand why a planet expected
to produce brilliant results gives only marginal results sometimes.

26.4  Taras (Stars)

26.4.1  Basic Tara Classification

We can count constellations from the constellation of natal Moon to the constellation
occupied by a planet in transit. Suppose natal Moon is in Makha and transit Mars is
in  Swaati.  Counting  constellations  from  Makha,  we  get  (1)  Maksha,  (2)  Poorva
Phalguni, (3) Uttara Phalguni, (4) Hasta, (5) Chitra and (6) Swaati. So Swaati is the
6th constellation from natal Moon’s constellation.

Different  constellations  from  the  constellation  of  natal  Moon  stand  for  different
things, as shown in Table 64. If a planet is in a bad tara in its transit, it cannot give its
full  results.  If  dasa  lord  and  antardasa  lord  as  per  Vimsottari  dasa  are  in  bad  taras,
bad results can be expected.

Let us take an example. Bill Gates has natal Moon in Uttarabhadrapada constellation.
His company received an adverse ruling from a judge who ordered a breakup of the
company, on June 8, 2000. Saturn and Jupiter were transiting in Krittika, Sun, Venus
and  Mars  were  in  Mrigasira.  From  Uttarabhadrapada,  Krittika  is  the  5th  star,  i.e.
pratyak tara (star of obstacles), and Mrigasira is the 7th star, i.e. naidhana tara (star of
death). With 5 planets transiting in bad taras, tara bala (strength of stars) was weak.

Taras are also used in muhurtas. At the time of an auspicious effort or when a new
project is launched, transit Moon should not be in a bad constellation with respect to
the natal Moon’s constellation.

26.4.2  Special Nakshatras/Taras

In addition to the above general classification, we have a few special nakshatras for
each person:

(1)  The  constellation  occupied  by  natal  Moon  is  called  Janma  nakshatra.  Janma

means “birth” and this nakshatra shows general well-being.

(2)  The 10th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Karma nakshatra. Karma
means “profession” and this nakshatra shows profession and workplace.
(3)  The  18th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Saamudaayika
nakshatra.  Saamudaayika  roughly  means  “related  to  a  crowd”  and  this
nakshatra shows group activities.

(4)  The 16th constellation from janma nakshatra is called Sanghaatika nakshatra.
Sanghaatika  roughly  means  “belonging  to  group”  and  this  nakshatra  shows
group/social activities.

(5)  The  4th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Jaati  nakshatra.  Jaati
roughly means “community” and this nakshatra shows one’s community. To be
more  correct,  one’s  jaati  shows  people  who  belong  to  the  same  class,  nature
and profession.

  350

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(6)  The  7th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Naidhana  nakshatra.

Naidhana means “death” and this nakshatra shows death and suffering.

(7)  The  12th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Desa  nakshatra.  Desa

means “country” and this nakshatra shows one’s country.

(8)  The  13th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Abhisheka  nakshatra.
Abhisheka means “coronation” and this nakshatra shows power and authority.
This is also called Raajya nakshatra (kingdom).

(9)  The  19th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Aadhaana  nakshatra.
Aadhaana  means  “epoch/conception”  and  this  nakshatra  shows  well-being  of
family.

(10)  The  22th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Vainaasika/Vinaasana
nakshatra.  Vainaasika  means  “destructive”  and  this  nakshatra  shows  one’s
destruction.

(11)  The  25th  constellation  from  janma  nakshatra  is  called  Maanasa  nakshatra.

Maanasa means “mind” and this nakshatra shows one’s mental state.

Benefics or malefics situated in these constellations in their transit bring good or bad
results  related  to  the  area  covered  by  the  nakshatra.  However,  it  should  be  kept  in
mind  that  the  results  will  be  with  respect  to  the  native.  For  example,  malefics
transiting  in  desa  nakshatra  may  not  ruin  one’s  country.  After  all,  any  country  has
almost the same number of people with desa nakshatra in each constellation. When
many malefics are transiting in desa nakshatra, one may be driven away from one’s
country  or  start  hating  one’s  country.  Similarly,  many  malefics  transiting  in  jaati
nakshatra  may  alienate  one  from  one’s  community.    Many  benefics  transiting  in
karma nakshatra may give success at workplace. This is how these special nakshatras
should be used. Sometimes, using these nakshtras gives special insights that cannot
be gained by looking at any divisional chart.

As an example, let us take Bill Gates who has natal Moon in Uttarabhadrapada. His
jaati nakshatra is the 4th from Uttarabhadrapada, i.e. Bharani. His karma nakshatra is
the  10th  from  Uttarabhadrapada,  i.e.  Pushyami.  When  Saturn  was  transiting  in
Bharani,  several  people  in  the  software  community  turned  against  Bill  Gates  and
gave  damaging  testimonies  in  a  lawsuit  to  determine  whether  his  company  was  a
monopoly  employing  unfair  tactics  against  competitors.  He  was  more  or  less
alienated in the  community of software entrepreneurs. At the same time,  Rahu was
transiting in Pushyami and that brought tension related to litigation at his workplace.

Exercise  41:  Consider  a  native  born  in  Leo  lagna.  He  has  Moon  also  in  Leo  in
Poorva  Phalguni  constellation.  Let  us  say  Jupiter
in
Poorvaashaadha  constellation  with  Mars.  Mars  is  a  yogakaraka  from  natal  lagna.
Jupiter is transiting in his moolatrikona, in the 5th house from natal lagna and Moon.
That’s  very  favorable  transit.  Find  out  if  transit  Jupiter  and  transit  Mars  are  in  a
special nakshatra. Based on it, try to guess the area in which the transit did good to
the native.

transiting

is

Exercise  42:  For  a  native  with  lagna  in  Leo,  natal  Moon  is  in  the  4th  quarter  of
Dhanishtha.  When  the  transit  chart  contains  Saturn  in  Bharani,  identify  a  possible
result.

Exercise  43:  For  a  native  with  natal  Moon  in  the  3rd  quarter  of  Poorvabhadrapada
and  lagna  in  Virgo,  transit  of  Mars  in  Aasresha  constellation  in  Cancer  brought
material gains. Cancer is the 6th from natal Moon and 11th from natal lagna. Both are
favorable  transits  and  so  it  makes  sense  that  this  transit  gave  material  gains.  Now
find out if Mars occupies a special constellation and, based on it, guess the nature of
the gains.

26.5  Nakshatra-based Aspects

Sun and Moon aspect the 14th and 15th constellations from them. Mars aspects the 1st,
3rd,  7th,  8th  and  15th  constellations  from  him.  Mercury  and  Venus  aspect  the  1st  and
15th  constellations  from  them.  Jupiter  aspects  the  10th,  15th  and  19th  constellations
from him. Saturn aspects the 3rd, 5th, 15th and 19th constellations from him.

A natural benefic gives good results related to the constellations aspected by it and a
natural malefic gives bad results related to the constellations aspected by it.

Exercise 44: For the native of Exercise 42, transit Mars was in Swaati when transit
Saturn  was  in  Bharani.  Identify  the  constellations  aspected  by  Mars  and  see  if  any
special constellations are included. If so, predict the possible result.

26.6  Constellations and Body Parts

When they are transiting in various constellations as counted from janma nakshatra,
planets are said to dwell in different parts of one’s body and correspondingly some
standard results are attributed. These results are given in Table 65 – Table 69.

There are two different purposes for these tables:

(1)  We can find the standard results for planetary transits in different constellations

with respect to the constellation of natal Moon.

(2)  If a native has a disease or problem in a particular body part, we may be able to
use these tables and figure out the planet causing it. That can help us in deciding
the  right  remedial  measures.  We  can  also  take  preventive  measures  before  the
transit.

If  a  planet  dwells  in  the  left  hand  in  transit  and  some  natural  malefics  aspect  it  or
cause vedha on it, then the planet may give suffering related to the left hand. Some
injuries to the left hand are possible then.

Let  us  consider  a  native  who  has  natal  Moon  in  the  1st  quarter  of  Visakha.  He  had
some  persistent  pain  in  his  chest  in  February  2000.  Let  us  determine  the  planet
responsible for it.

One can find from Table 65  that Sun dwells in chest during his transit in the 6th, 7th,
8th and 9th nakshatras from janma nakshatra. From Visakha, they are Uttaraashaadha,
Sravana, Dhanishtha and Satabhisha. Sun transited in these stars during Jan 11-Mar
3, 2000. The chest troubles when Sun was dwelling in chest can be related to Sun.

At the time Sun entered Capricorn in January 2000, Moon was in Ar and hence Sun
is a taamra murthi (copper form) for people with natal Moon in Li. At the time Sun
entered Aquarius in February 2000, Moon was in Ta and hence Sun is a loha murthi
(iron form) for people with natal Moon in Li. Being a copper/iron form dwelling in
the chest, Sun brought chest pains.

26.7  Latta (Kick)

Latta  is  a  nakshatra-based  planetary  kick.  Each  planet  has  latta  (kick)  on  a
constellation  based  on  its  transit  position.  If  a  transit  planet  has  latta  on  the
constellation occupied by Moon (or lagna) in natal chart, then we may expect some
unfavorable results related to the signification of the planet in natal chart.

Purolatta (forward kick):

(1) Sun has latta on the 12th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direction.
If  Sun  is  in  Mrigasira,  for  example,  he  has  latta  on  the  12th  nakshatra  from
Mrigasira, i.e. Visakha.

Part 3: Transit Analysis

355

(2) Mars has latta on the 3rd nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direction.
If  Mars  is  in  Mrigasira,  for  example,  he  has  latta  on  the  3rd  nakshatra  from
Mrigasira, i.e. Punarvasu.

(3) Jupiter has latta on the 6th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direction.
If  Jupiter  is  in  Krittika,  for  example,  he  has  latta  on  the  6th  nakshatra  from
Krittika, i.e. Pushyami.

(4) Saturn has latta on the 8th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the forward direction.
If  Saturn  is  in  Krittika,  for  example,  he  has  latta  on  the  8th  nakshatra  from
Krittika, i.e. Makha.

Prishtha latta (backward kick):

(5) Moon  has  latta  on  the  22nd  nakshatra  from  him,  reckoned  in  the  backward
direction. If Moon is in Anuradha, for example, he has latta on the 22nd nakshatra
(backwards) from Anuradha, i.e. Dhanishtha.

(6) Mercury  has  latta  on  the  7th  nakshatra  from  him,  reckoned  in  the  backward
direction.  If  Mercury  is  in  Punarvasu,  for  example,  he  has  latta  on  the  7th
nakshatra (backwards) from Punarvasu, i.e. Aswini.

(7) Venus  has  latta  on  the  5th  nakshatra  from  him,  reckoned  in  the  backward
direction. If Venus is in Mrigasira, for example, he has latta on the 5th nakshatra
(backwards) from Mrigasira, i.e. Aswini.

(8) Rahu has latta on the 9th nakshatra from him, reckoned in the backward direction.
If  Rahu  is  in  Punarvasu,  for  example,  he  has  latta  on  the  9th  nakshatra
(backwards) from Punarvasu, i.e. Uttarabhadrapada.

If  the  6th  lord  has  latta  on  janma  nakshatra  (nakshatra  occupied  by  natal  Moon)  or
lagna nakshatra (nakshatra occupied by natal lagna) in his transit, then some troubles
related to litigation or disease or enemies may be expected. If the 7th lord has latta on
janma  nakshatra  or  lagna  nakshatra  in  his  transit,  then  some  troubles  related  to
marriage  or  spouse  or  relations  can  be  expected.  If  an  important  planet  in  the  10th
house in natal chart has a latta on janma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra in transit, then
some  troubles  in  career  may  be  expected.  We  usually  see  some  loss  related  to  the
natal significations of a planet having latta on janma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra in
transit. This is an important concept and readers should memorize the latta formulas.

Example 113: Let us consider a native whose janma nakshatra is Poorvabhadrapada
and lagna nakshatra is Hasta. Let us see if any bad result is possible, using lattas, on
the evening of 5th December 1996.

Let us find if any planet has latta on Poorvabhadrapada or Hasta.

Natal lagna is in Virgo, as Hasta is in Virgo. There are two lattas on lagna nakshatra
–  Hasta.  One  is  by  8th  lord  Mars  and  the  other  is  by  lagna  lord  Mercury.  So  bad
results  relating  to  1st  and  8th  houses  are  possible.  The  6th  and  8th  houses  show
accidents.

However,  latta  on  janma  nakshatra  is  more  important.  Here  Jupiter  has  latta  on
Poorvabhadrapada.  Jupiter  owns  the  4th  and  7th  houses  in  the  natal  chart.  So  some
misfortune related to vehicle or house or marital life is possible.

The native had a vehicular accident on the evening of 5th December 1996, in which
his  car  was  totaled;  i.e.  it  was  so  damaged  that  his  insurance  company  found  it
cheaper to give a new car instead of repairing it.

Exercise 45: Consider the chart of Bill Gates (see Chart 24). On 8th June 2000, his
company  received  an  unfavorable  ruling  from  a  US  judge  in  a  landmark  anti-trust
lawsuit.  Find  if  any  planets  had  latta  on  janma  nakshatra  or  lagna  nakshatra  at  the
time of the ruling. Find the common house related to those planets in the natal chart.

26.8  Sarvatobhadra Chakra

Definition: Sarvatah means “everywhere” or “entirely”. Bhadra means “auspicious”
or  “well”.  Sarvatobhadra  chakra  is  a  chart  that  shows  all-round  well-being  and  all
kinds of auspicious and inauspicious results.

Figure 3: Sarvatobhadra Chakra

  358

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

There  are  9  x  9  =  81  squares  in  the  chart.  Middle  7  squares  on  the  outer  borders
contains  7  nakshatras  each.  Abhijit  (the  last  quarter  of  Uttarashadha)  is  included
among the nakshatras. The innermost 5 squares contains weekdays and tithis (lunar
days). The notation regarding tithis is:

(1) The entry Nanda represents 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st and 26th tithis.
(2) The entry Bhadra represents 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd and 27th tithis.
(3) The entry Jaya represents 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd and 28th tithis.
(4) The entry Rikta represents 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, 24th and 29th tithis.
(5) The entry Poorna represents 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 30th tithis.

Rasis  are  also  included  in  the  chart.  Some  consonants  are  listed  in  the  squres  just
inside the border squares. All the squares lying on diagonals of the chart, except the
central square of the chart, contain vowels. There are 16 vowels and 20 consonants
that  are  covered.  We  see  that  16  (vowels)  +  20  (consonants)  +  12  (rasis)  +  28
(nakshtras) + 5 (tithis and weekdays) = 81.

Vedha:  When  a  planet  occupies  a  nakshatra,  it  causes  vedha  (obstruction)  on  the
contents of the squares along 3 lines. We can draw one vertical or horizontal line and
two  crossward  lines  starting  at  the  nakshatra.  Contents  of  the  squares  on  the  lines
have vedha from the planet.

Example  114:  Let  us  say  Saturn  is  in  Punarvasu.  We  see  that  Punarvasu  is  on  the
eastern border.

Drawing a horizontal line to the west from it, we see that the consonant h, rasi Cn,
vowel  au,  tithis  Bhadra  (2nd,  7th,  12th,  17th,  22nd  and  27th),  weekdays  Monday  and
Wednesday, vowel am, rasi Sc, consonant y and constellation Moola are on this line.
So Saturn in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these.

Drawing a crossward line to the northwest from it, we see that the consonant k, rasis
Ta  and  Ar,  consonant  d  and  constellation  Poorva  Bhadrapada  are  on  this  line.  So
Saturn in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these.

Part 3: Transit Analysis

359

Drawing  a  crossward  line  to  the  southwest  from  it,  we  see  that  the  consonant  d
(alveolar), consonant m and constellation Uttara Phalguni are on this line. So Saturn
in Punarvasu causes vedha on all these.

Exercise  46:  Find  all  the  consonants,  vowels,  tithis,  weekdays,  rasis  and
constellations on which Venus in Makha has vedha.

There are some special principles:

(1) A planet in the first quarter of Krittika or the last quarter of Bharani has vedha on
the vowel “a” which is in the northeastern corner. A similar thing applies to all
the vowels in corners.

(2) If an vowel has vedha, its similar vowel (e.g. a and aa, i and ee, u and uu) also

has vedha from the same planet.

(3) Some consonants are not covered in this chart. Planets in Ardra have vedha on g,
chh  and  ng  (nasal).  Planets  in  Hasta  have  vedha  on  h,  n  (alveolar)  and  th
(alveolar).  Planets  in  Poorvashadha  have  vedha  on  dh  (dental),  ph  and  dh
(alveolar).  Planets  in  Uttara  Bhadrapada  have  vedha  on  th  (dental),  jh  and  nch
(nasal).

(4) If a planet has vedha on one of the following pairs of consonants, it has vedha on
the other one too: b & v; s & sh (palatal); kh & sh (alveolar); j & y; ng & tr.

Using Sarvatobhadra Chakra70: We should find the following in the natal chart:

(1) the constellation occupied by Moon or any special tara
(2) the rasi occupied by lagna or any house of interest
(3) the first/prominent consonant and vowel in the native’s name
(4) the tithi of birth (janma tithi) or a special tithi
(5) the weekday of birth (janma vaara)

We  should  study  the  vedha  caused  on  these  by  different  planets  in  their  transit.
Vedha  by  benefics  (Moon,  Mercury,  Jupiter  and  Venus)  is  favorable  and  vedha  by
malefics  (Sun,  Mars,  Saturn,  Rahu  and  Ketu)  is  unfavorable.  If  several  transiting
benefics  have  simultaneous  vedha  on  several  natal  points  listed  above,  then  good
results may be expected. Malefics, on the other hand, give bad results.

70 This author’s experience in the use of Sarvatobhadra Chakra is very very limited.

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

In  addition  to  considering  janma  nakshatra,  we  can  consider  special  nakshatras
related to the matter of interest. Suppose we want to find the transit results related to
career. Then we can take karma nakshatra of natal chart and see the vedhas on it in
transit chart.

Similarly, we can take the tithi corresponding to the matter of interest. For example,
we  can  take  “karma  tithi”  (lunar  day  of  profession)  instead  of  janma  tithi  when
finding transit results related to career.

Readers  should  refer  to  the  first  chapter  for  the  procedure  of  finding  tithis.  Karma
tithi  is  a  little  different  from  normal  tithi.  To  find  karma  tithi,  we  multiply  the
difference  between  Moon’s  longitude  and  Sun’s  longitude  with  10  and  reduce  the
product to a value between 0º and 360º (by adding or subtracting multiples of 360º).
We divide it by 12 and add 1 to the quotient. That gives a number between 1 and 30
and  that  represents  “karma  tithi”.  Karma  tithi  changes  10  times  as  fast  as  normal
tithi.  Similarly  “dhana  tithi”  (lunar  day  of  wealth)  changes  twice  as  fast  as  normal
tithi.  We  can  find  a  tithi  for  several  matters.  The  tithi  relevant  to  the  matter  of
interest  should  be  used  when  finding  vedha  of  transiting  planets  on  tithis  (Nanda,
Bhadra, Jaya, Rikta and Poorna).

Let  us  take  an  example.  If  the  10th  house,  karma  nakshatra,  karma  tithi  and  janma
vaara  all  have  the  vedha  of  a  couple  of  transiting  benefics,  then  some  good
developments  may  take  place  in  the  native’s  career.  If  they  have  the  vedha  of  a
couple of malefics (instead of benefics), then we can expect setbacks in the native’s
career.  In  this  manner,  we  study  the  impact  of  transits  on  important  tithis,  janma
vaara,  important  nakshatras  and  important  houses  in  natal  chart.  If  just  one  natal
reference has vedha from just one planet, we cannot make any predictions. But, if 2-
3  natal  reference  have  vedha  from  a  couple  of  benefic/malefic  transit  planets,  then
we can be more confident. However, a prediction should be made only if dasas and
Tajaka charts also show an event.

Example  115:  Let  us  consider  the  death  of  John  F.  Kennedy,  Jr.  The  data  of  birth
and death can be found in Example 107.

Part 3: Transit Analysis

361

Janma tithi is Sukla Ashtami (8th tithi) and it belongs to the Jaya group. Janma vaara
is Thursday71. Jama nakshatra is Dhanishtha. Vainasika nakshatra (destruction) is in
Anooradha.  Naidhana  nakshatra  (constellation  of  death)  is  in  Bharani.  If  all  these
natal  reference  points  have  vedha  from  a  couple  of  natural  malefics,  then  death  is
more  likely  on  other  days.  Of  course,  one  will  not  die  whenever  this  happens,  but
this will increase the chances of death.

In the transit chart, Saturn is in naidhana nakshatra Bharani. Mars is in Swati. Rahu
is in Asresha. Ketu is in Sravanam.

If  we  draw  crossward  lines  from  Ketu  in  Sravanam  and  Saturn  in  Bharani,  we  can
see  that  they  intersect  in  the  square  containing  Jaya  and  Thursday.  So  janma  tithi
(Jaya)  and  janma  vaara  (Thursday)  have  vedha  from  Ketu  and  Saturn.  Janma
nakshatra  Dhanishtha  has  vedha  from  Ketu  in  Sravanam  and  Rahu  in  Asresha.
Vainaasika  nakshatra  Anooradha  also  comes  under  the  vedha  of  Saturn  in  Bharani
and Rahu in Asresha. The house of accidents Cp, which is the 3rd house from AL in
natal chart, comes under vedha from Ketu in Sravanam and Mars in Swati.

Considering that several key natal references are coming under the vedha of a couple
of  malefics,  unfavorable  results  are  possible.  Considering  the  involvement  of
naidhana and vainaasika nakshatras, death is possible.

Example  116:  Let  us  consider  Rajiv  Gandhi’s  ascension  to  power  in  India  on
October  31,  1984.  It  was  covered  in  Exercise  40.  Rasi  chart  of  Mr.  Gandhi  can  be
found in Chart 39.

At  the  time  of  the  event,  Jupiter  was  in  Poorvashadha,  Venus  was  in  Jyeshtha,
Mercury was in Visakha and Moon was in Sravanam. Let us see if they have vedhas
on any important natal references. Here are the vedhas:

(1)  Jupiter  and  Mercury  both  have  vedha  on  Nanda  and  Sunday.  Sunday  is  the
weekday of birth. The tithi of power (5th) is Sukla Shashthi (Nanda group).

(2)  Mercury  and  Moon  both  have  vedha  on  Dhanishtha  (abhisheka  nakshatra  –

constellation of coronation).

71  As  per  the  western  calendar,  Friday  came  at  midnight  and  the  native  was  born  at  12:22  am.
However, a new day starts at sunrise for Hindus. So it was still Thursday.

  362

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(3)  Jupiter  and  Venus  both  have  vedha  on  Sg,  which  is  the  5th  house  of  power  in

natal chart.

(4)  Mercury and Venus both have vedha on Libra, which contains GL in natal chart.

GL is the seat of power.

So janma vaara, an important tithi, an important nakshatra and two important rasis in
natal  chart  have  vedha  from  two  benefic  planets  each.  This  is  conducive  to  getting
political power.

Example  117:  Let  us  continue  with  the  same  native.  Rajiv  Gandhi’s  party  lost
majority in the elections of November 22, 1989.

When  he  became  India’s  Prime  Minister  in  1984,  Jupiter  was  in  Poorvashadha.
Poorvashadha  is  karma  nakshatra  (constellation  of  profession).  At  the  time  of  Mr.
Gandhi’s defeat in 1989, Saturn was in that constellation.

Let us find vedhas by transit planets on the same natal references considered in the
last example:

(1) Nanda and Sunday have vedha from 3 malefics: Saturn in Poorvashadha, Rahu in

Dhanishtha and Ketu in Asresha.

(2) Dhanishtha  is  Abhisheka  nakshatra  (constellation  of  coronation).  It  is  occupied

by Rahu and Ketu has vedha on it.

(3) The 5th house of power in the natal chart, Sg, has vedha from Mars and Saturn.

For  these  reasons,  transits  were  unfavorable  from  the  point  of  view  of  political
power. So Mr. Gandhi’s party lost power.

26.9  Conclusion

Several important topics related to transits in nakshatras were covered in this chapter.
One  should  carefully  learn  and  practice  all  these  classical  nakshatra-based
techniques. However, new students should not make predictions just based on these
techniques.  Any  technique  that  divides  people  into  27  groups  and  gives  the  same
result for everyone in the same group can be correct only to a limited extent. These
methods should be used in conjunction with other chart-sensitive methods.

26.10  Answers to the Exercises

Exercise 41:

Poorvaashaadha  is  the  10th  constellation  from  Poorva  Phalguni.  So  the  favorable
transit  of  Jupiter  and  Mars  happens  to  be  in  the  Karma  nakshatra,  which  shows
profession. So the good results to be experienced may be related to profession.

Final  Answer:  The  details  belong  to  Rajiv  Gandhi.  He  suddenly  became  India’s
Prime Minister during the said transit. We gave his birthdata earlier.

Exercise 42:

Bharani  is  the  7th  constellation  from  Dhanishtha,  i.e.  it  is  the  naidhana  nakshatra
(death).  Saturn  is  a  malefic  and  the  7th  lord  –  and  hence  a  maraka  –  here.  So  this
transit has the potential to bring death. Of course, not everyone with lagna in Leo and
Moon in Dhanishtha dies then72, but death is a possibility during the transit.

Final  Answer:  The  details  belong  to John  F.  Kennedy,  Jr.  He  died  in  a plane  crash
during the said transit. We gave his birthdata earlier.

Exercise 43:

Aasresha  is  the  12th  constellation  from  Poorvabhaadrapada,  i.e.  Desa  nakshatra.
Being  a  debilitated  malefic  in  desa  nakshatra  (country),  Mars  can  drive  him  out  of
his country. That was indeed how Mars  gave gains to the native of Chart 63 in the
second week of November 1994. The native left his motherland India then.

Exercise 44:

Mars aspects the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 15th constellations from him. Mars in Swaati will
aspect  (1)  Swaati,  (2)  Anooradha,  (3)  Uttaraashaadha,  (4)  Sravanam,  and,  (5)
Bharani. Because natal Moon is in Dhanishtha, these are the 20th, 22nd, 26th, 27th and

72  These  transit  principles  based  on  nakshtra  give  good  insight  into  future,  but  one  cannot  make
predictions just based on them.

  364

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

7th  constellations  (respectively)  from  janma  nakshatra.  Out  of  these,  2  are  special
nakshatras.  The  7th  constellation  is  known  as  naidhana  nakshatra  and  shows  death.
The  22nd  nakshatra  is  known  as  vainaasika  nakshatra  and  shows  destruction.  Mars
aspects  both.  As  seen  in  Exercise  42,  maraka  in  the  natal  chart  Saturn  occupies
naidhana nakshatra73. The predicted result is death.74

Final Answer: As already mentioned, Mr. Kennedy passed away during this transit.

Exercise 45:

Rahu  was  in  Punarvasu  at  that  time.  He  had  latta  on  the  9th  from  Punarvasu
backwards,  which  is  Uttarabhadrapada,  i.e.  janma  nakshatra!  So  Rahu  had  latta  on
janma nakshatra. Mars was in Mrigasira at the time and he had latta on the 3rd from
Mrigasira, which is Punarvasu, i.e. lagna nakshatra!

Rahu  occupies  the  6th  house  in  the  natal  chart  and  Mars  owns  it.  So  the  setbacks
given by their lattas on janma nakshatra and lagna nakshatra were related to the 6th
house matters – litigation and enemies.

Exercise 46:

(1) Verical  line  in  the  northern  direction  has  uu,  d  (alveolar),  h,  k,  v,  a,  u  and

Bharani.

(2) Crossward line in the northeastern direction has Asresha.
(3) Crossward  line  in  the  northwestern  direction  has  m,  Le,  Bhadra  (2nd,  7th,  12th,
17th, 22nd and 27th), Monday, Wednesday, Jaya (3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd and 28th),
Thursday, Cp, kh and Sravanam.

73  In  the  natal  chart,  Mars  occupies  his  Mrityu  Bhaga  (part  of  death).  So  his  aspect  over  the  two
special constellations is also significant.
74 It will be very hasty to predict someone’s death just based on conjunctions and aspects on special
nakshatras in transit. Out of the many people with the same nakshatra, only those people whose dasas
and Tajaka charts also show death will die at the time of this death-inflicting transit.

Part 4:   Tajaka Analysis

A sub-system of Indian astrology, popularly known as “Tajaka
system”,  is  extremely  useful  in  making  precise  and  pointed
predictions.  It  considers  planetary  aspects  and  yogas  different
from  those  employed  in  other  classical  methods  of  Vedic
astrology  and  it  is  closer  to  western  astrology  in  terms  of
aspects and yogas. In fact, some scholars may validly question
why  Tajaka  system  is  being  covered  in  a  book  on  Vedic
astrology. There are no references to it in the works of Parasara,
Jaimini  and  other  maharshis.  The  oldest  reference  to  these
techniques to be found in the works of a respected authority on
Vedic  astrology  is  in  “Tajaka  Neelakanthi”,  a  work  by
Neelakantha  who  wrote  a  celebrated  commentary  on  “Jaimini
Sutras”. His coverage of Tajaka system lends some authenticity
to the system. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked
about this system  in parts that are possibly  missing today.  We
will  cover  this  system    in  this  book,  because  some  illustrious
scholars  of  Vedic  astrology,  like  Neelakantha  and  Dr.  B.V.
Raman, set the precedent by teaching this system.

  366

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

This system is based on solar return charts.  When Sun returns
every year to the position he occupied in the zodiac at the time
of  a  person’s  birth,  a  new  year  is  said  to  commence  for  the
person and a chart drawn for that time is called “Tajaka annual
chart”  or  “Tajaka  varsha  chakra”.  Analysis  of  this  chart  can
give  insights  into  what  may  be  in  store  during  the  one  year
following the solar return. Results suggested in the annual chart
can  take  place  only  if  they  are  ‘possible’  based  on  natal  chart
also. However, annual chart often gives a finer insight into the
year in question than natal chart.

A few special dasa systems enable timing of events within the
365-day period of operation of an annual chart.

Similar  to  the  annual  charts,  “monthly  solar  return  charts”
(Tajaka masa chakras) can also be drawn and they are useful in
analyzing a one-month period in depth.

This part explains the casting and use of annual charts in giving
precise predictions.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

367

27.  Tajaka Chart Basics

27.1  Casting Annual Charts

Sun moves with respect to earth at the rate of 30° per month. He takes one  year to
complete one cycle through the zodiac. He returns to the position occupied by him at
the time of one’s birth after every one-year period. At the exact moment when Sun
returns to the exact position he occupied at the time of a person’s birth, a new year
is  said  to  commence  in  the  life  of  that  person.  A  chart  can  be  cast  for  the
commencement  of  the  new  year.  This  is  called  a  Tajaka  varsha  chakra  or  a  Tajaka
annual chart75. The longitude and latitude of the birthplace must be used in casting
this chart, irrespective of the place of living at the commencement of the new year.

The  commencement  of  a  new  year  is  called  “varsha  pravesh”  by  some  people.
Varsha means a year and pravesh means entry.

Example 118:

Let us take a native with this birthdata: 8th March 1967, 5:40 pm (IST), 73 E 04, 26
N 18. Sun occupies 23° 50' 25'' in Aq in his birthchart. Suppose we want analyze the
one-year period of March 2000-March 2001 using Tajaka annual chart.

Then we should find the date and time when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Aq in March
2000.  We  find  that  Sun  enters  this  position  at  4:41:21  am  on  8th  March  2000.  The
native finishes 33 years and enters his 34th year at that time.

We can erect a chart with the following data: 8th March 2000, 4:41:21 am (IST), 73 E
04,  26  N  1876.  That  chart  is  called  the  native’s  Tajaka  annual  chart  for  2000-2001.
Rasi chart erected with this data is shown in Chart 66. Along with this rasi chart, we
can draw all the divisional charts at this time.

75  Western  astrologers  also  use  similar  charts  and  call  them  “solar  return”  charts.  Some  Indian
astrologers call these “varshaphal” charts. Varshaphal means “results for one year”.
76 Even if the  native is living  on the other side of  the globe,  we  must still cast the annual chart for
birthplace co-ordinates. So we are using the longitude and latitude of his birthplace here.

  368

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 66

By analyzing this rasi chart and the associated divisional charts, we can find out the
fortune of the native during the year. The matters shown by various divisional charts,
houses, rasis, planets, arudha padas etc remain the same. To time events within this
year, we have annual dasas. We will learn them in later chapters.

27.2  An Approximate Method

The exact time of the commencement of new year is determined by finding the exact
time when Sun enters the exact position occupied by him at the time of one’s birth.
However, this can be a laborious calculation to do manually. To make this task less
challenging,  some  scholars  devised  approximate  methods  based  on  the  number  of
days in an average solar year. A sidereal solar year has 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes
and 12 seconds. Based on this, the amount of time to be added to the birthdata to find
the varsha pravesh data is given in Table 71.

Procedure:

(1) Find the birthday as per western calendar in the required year.

(2) Find  the  years  completed.  Find  the  corresponding  days,  hours,  minutes  and
seconds from Table 71. If the age is not in the list, express it as a sum of entries
found in the table and add their values. For example, suppose someone finished
46 years. Then add the values given for 40 years and 6 years.

(3) Add  the  days  found  above  to  the  weekday77  of  birth  and  find  the  resulting
weekday.  Find  the  nearest  date  to  the  birthday  found  in  (1)  that  falls  on  this
weekday. A time equal to the birthtime on this date is taken as a reference.

77 Remember that the weekday in Hindu calendar changes at sunrise and not at 12:00 midnight.

(4) Add the hours, minutes and seconds found in (2) to the reference date and time
found in (3). The result is the date and time of the commencement of new year.

(5) Find the planetary positions, lagna etc at this time for the longitude and latitude

of the birthplace.

Let  us  now  revisit  Example  118  and  calculate  varsha  pravesh  data  using  this
approximate method.

(1) Birthday is 8th March 1967. The 34th year starts in 2000. The birthday as per the

western calendar is on 8th March 2000.

(2) Finished years are 33 = 30 + 3. Adding the entries of 30 years and 3 years, we get

(from Table 71)

(3) Birthday  (8th  March  1967)  is  a  Wednesday.  Adding  6  days  to  it,  we  get  a
Tuesday.  We  now  have  to  find  the  Tuesday  nearest  to  8th  March  2000.  It  is  7th
March 2000. The time of birth on 8th March 1967 is 5:40 pm and we now take
5:40 pm on 7th March 2000 as the reference time.

(4) We have to add 11 hours, 2 minutes and 24 seconds found in (2) to the reference

time in (3). We get 4:42:24 am on 8th March 2000.

(5) We find rasi chart and all divisional charts for the data: 8th March 2000, 4:42:24

am (IST), 73 E 04, 26 N 18.

Please note that the time found here is wrong only by 1 minute. In some examples,
the error resulting from the approximation can be higher. However, this approximate
method is very convenient and quick.

NOTE:  Errors  due  to  ayanamsa  and  approximations  in  the  calculation  of  Sun’s
longitude  cause  greater  errors  than  this  approximation.  As  long  as  one  takes  the
correct  nonlinear  nature  of  ayanamsa  change  into  account,  there  will  not  be  any
considerable discrepancy in the varsha pravesh times found by people using different
ayanamsas.  But  ignoring  the  nonlinear  nature  of  ayanamsa  results  in  considerable
errors in varsha pravesh time. This is because lagna moves 360 times faster than Sun.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

371

Any small errors in Sun’s longitude result in errors in lagna which are 360 times as
large.

Exercise 47: Find the varsha pravesh data for the 27th year of the native in Example
118 using (a) the approximate method and (b) the exact method.

27.3  Casting Monthly Charts

A year is divided into 12 months and a new chart can be cast at the commencement
of every new month. This is called Tajaka maasa chakra or a Tajaka monthly chart.

The commencement of a new month is called “maasa pravesh” by some people.

A  year  is  the  period  in  which  Sun  moves  by  360º.  A  month  is  the  period  in  which
Sun moves by 30º.

Let us take the native of Example 118. He was born on 8th March 1967. Sun was at
23° 50' 25'' in Aq when he was born. On 8th March 2000, Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in
Aq at 4:41:21 am (IST) and a new year commences then. This is the 34th year in the
life of the native.

Along with the new  year, a new month commences then. This is the first month of
the year. This month ends and a new month commences after Sun moves by exactly
30°. Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Pi on 7th April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The second month
in  the  year  commences  then.  We  can  cast  rasi  chart  and  divisional  charts  at  that
moment.  Using  those  charts,  we  can  predict  events  in  the  next  one-month  period.
This month ends and the third month commences when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Ar.

Thus, when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in different rasis, we cast different monthly charts
and use them for predicting the events in a one-month period. The thing to remember
here is that “one month” is the time when Sun moves by exactly 30°.

There  isn’t  any  good  approximate  method  for  casting  monthly  charts.  Sun  takes
approximately  the  same  time  for  moving  by  360°  and  so  we  have  an  approximate
method for annual charts. But the time Sun takes to move by 30° varies considerably
from  month  to  month.  So  there  isn’t  any  approximate  method  that  gives  decent

  372

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

results.  It  may  be  wise  to  exactly  cast  12  monthly  charts  for  the  first  year  of  the
native and then find monthly charts in later years from them, using the approximate
method given for annual charts.

27.4  Casting Sixty-hour Charts

A month is again divided into 12 shashti-horas. Each shashti-hora period consists of
60 hours, i.e. 2.5 days. At the beginning of every shashti-hora, a Tajaka shashti-hora
chakra78 (Tajaka sixty-hour chart) is cast. In the period corresponding to each Tajaka
sixty-hour chart, Sun moves by 2º30'.

In  other  words,  we  can  cast  a  chart  after  every  2º30'  motion  of  Sun  and  use  that
Tajaka  sixty-hour  chart  to  predict  events  in  the  2.5-day  period  commencing  then.
There are exactly 12 such charts in a one-month period.

For  example,  let  us  take  the  second  month  of  the  year  2000-2001  for  the  native  of
Example 118. The second month commences when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Pi, i.e.
on 7th April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The first shashti-hora of the month also starts then.
It  ends  and  the  second  shashti-hora  or  60-hour  period  commences  when  Sun  is
advanced by 2º30', i.e. when Sun enters 26° 20' 25'' in Pi. This happens at 11:40:51
pm (IST) on 9th April 2000. If we cast a chart for that moment, we can make some
predictions for the next 2.5 days.

27.5  Conclusion

In this chapter, we learnt what Tajaka annual and monthly charts are and how they
are cast. When Sun re-enters every  year the same longitude occupied by him at the
time of one’s birth, it signals the commencement of a new  year in the native’s life.
We  can  cast  a  chart  for  that  exact  moment  and  predict  events  in  the  next  one  year
based on that chart. We can also cast monthly charts and sixty-hour charts.

These new years are based on the solar years and the commencement of new year is
around one’s birthday as per the modern western calendar. However, many Indians –
especially south Indians – celebrate birthday as per the lunar calendar. In fact, most

78 This is popularly known as just “Tajaka Hora Chakra”.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

373

Hindu  holidays  are  based  on  the  lunar  calendar.  For  example,  birthdays  of  Lord
Rama and Lord Krishna are celebrated based on the tithi and not based on the solar
calendar.  Lunar  calendar  is  of  great  importance  in  Indian  culture.  Correspondingly,
there  are  techniques  based  on  the  birthday  as  per  lunar  calendar.  However,  those
techniques are beyond the scope of this book and we will restrict ourselves to solar
birthday and Tajaka annual charts.

27.6  Answers to Exercises

Exercise 47:

(a) Approximate method:

(1)  The  approximate  birthday  of  the  27th  year  is  8th  March  1993.  He  completes  26

years then.

(2)  Adding the entries of 20 years and 6 years, we get 4 days 15 hr 58 min 12 sec.
(3)  Adding  4  days  to  Wednesday  (weekday  of  birth),  we  get  Sunday.  The  nearest
Sunday to 8th March 1993 is 7th March 1993. So we take 5:40 pm on 7th March
1993 as the reference time.

(4)  Add 15 hr 58 min 12 sec to this reference time. We get 9:38:12 am on 8th March

1993.

(b) Exact method:

Let us find the position of Sun at the above time. At 9:38:12 am (IST) on 8th March
1993, Sun is at 23° 50'  29'' in  Aq. Natal position is 23° 50' 25'' in  Aq.  We have to
subtract  about  2  minutes  of  time  to  get  Sun  4''  behind.  The  correct  varshapravesh
data is – 9:36:18 am (IST) on 8th March 1993.

28.  Techniques of Tajaka Charts

28.1  Muntha

Muntha is a concept specific to Tajaka charts. Progress lagna in the natal chart at the
rate of one rasi per year to get muntha in an annual chart. Suppose someone finishes
31 years and starts the 32nd year on a given date. Suppose we are casting the annual
chart of the 32nd  year. Suppose the natal chart has lagna in Sc. Then muntha in the
annual  chart  will  be  the  32nd  house  from  Sc,  i.e.  the  8th  house  from  Sc  (after
expunging multiples of 12 from 32). So muntha is in Ge.

Muntha is very important in Tajaka charts. Muntha is as important a reference point
in an annual chart as lagna. The reason may be obvious in the chapter on “Sudarsana
Chakra  Dasa”.  Some  people  find  muntha  in  monthly  charts  by  progressing  natal
lagna by 2º30' per month. This author takes a different stand and the readers may be
able to appreciate this after reading the same chapter.

Look at the planets in muntha. They tell us the nature of events in the year or month.
For example, Jupiter in muntha may give good results, happiness from children and
knowledge.  Saturn  in  muntha  may  make  one  sluggish,  unhealthy,  frustrated  and
sorrowful. Of course, the strength of the planets influencing muntha also matters. For
example,  an  afflicted  and  weak  Jupiter  in  muntha  may  give  loss  of  position,  bad
name and scandals.

Position of muntha in various houses with  respect to lagna in the  annual  chart  also
tells  us  the  nature  of  events  in  a  year.  Situation  of  muntha  in  the  9th,  10th  and  11th
houses  is  excellent.  It  gives  prosperity,  status  and  gains  respectively.  Situation  of
muntha in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th houses is also good. It gives health, wealth, success
and  fame  respectively.  Situation  of  muntha  in  the  6th,  8th  and  12th  houses  is  bad.  It
gives  illness,  troubles  and  expenditures  respectively.  Situation  of  muntha  in  the  4th
house gives disputes and loss of position. Situation of muntha in the 7th house also
gives troubles in marriage and many hardships.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

28.2  Aspects

In Tajaka analysis, we consider the following aspects:79

(1) Trinal  aspect:  A  planet  has  a  strong  benefic  aspect  on  the  5th  and  9th  houses

from it and on the planets in those houses.

(2) Sextile  aspect:  A  planet  has  a  weak  benefic  aspect  on  the  3rd  and  11th  houses

from it and on the planets in those houses.

(3) Square  aspect:  A  planet  has  a  weak  malefic  aspect  on  the  4th  and  10th  houses

from it and on the planets in those houses.

(4) Conjunction:  A  planet  has  a  strong  malefic  aspect  on  the  planets  in  the  same

house occupied by it.

(5) Opposition: A planet has a strong malefic aspect on the 7th house from it and on

the planets in that house.

(6) Semi-sextile  aspect:  A  planet  has  a  neutral  aspect  on  the  2nd  and  12th  houses

from it and on the planets in those houses.

Deeptamsa is “the orb of an aspect”. Deeptamsas of planets: Sun – 15º, Moon – 12º,
Mars – 8º, Mercury – 7º, Jupiter – 9º, Venus – 7º, Saturn – 9º. If Venus is at 13º in
Li,  he  will  have  a  trinal  aspect  on  Ge,  but  his  aspect  doesn’t  cover  the  entire  rasi.
Venusian  aspect  covers  an  angle  of  7º  from  13º  in  Gemini  mainly,  though  Venus
may  have  a  moderate  aspectual  influence  on  the  entire  rasi.  So  Venus  mainly
influences 6º–20º in Ge by aspect. Deeptamsa is the same for all kinds of  aspects.

28.3  Harsha Bala

Harsha  bala80  of  seven  planets  is  found  by  adding  the  strengths  given  by  the
following 4 sources of strength:

79  These  aspects  are  similar  to  the  ones  used  in  western  astrology.  Considering  that  graha  and  rasi
aspects were mentioned by maharshis, the exact meaning and use of these special aspects needs to be
further  researched  and  correctly  understood.  The  current  understanding  of  scholars  may  be
incomplete. Rishi prokta (words spoken by great sages) should form the basis of our knowledge.
80 Harsha means “cheerful” and bala means “strength”. This is the strength of cheerfulness.

  376

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(1) Sun in the 9th house, Moon in the 3rd house, Mars in the 6th house, Mercury in the
1st house, Jupiter in the 11th house, Venus in the 5th house and Saturn in the 12th
house get 5 units. They get zero units in other houses.

(2) A planet in exaltation or own sign gets 5 units (else zero units).
(3) Feminine planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus and Saturn) get 5 units in the 1st, 2nd,
3rd 7th, 8th and 9th houses. Masculine planets (Sun, Mars and Jupiter) get 5 units in
the 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th, 11th and 12th houses.

(4) If  the  new  year  starts  in  the  daytime,  masculine  planets  get  5  units  each.  If  the

new year starts in the night time, feminine planets get 5 units each.

A  planet  with  20  units  of  strength  is  exceedingly  strong.  A  planet  with  15  units  of
strength is fully strong. A planet with 10 units of strength is of average strength. A
planet with 5 units of strength has only a little strength. A planet with zero units of
strength has no strength at all.

Example  119:  Let  us  find  Harsha  bala  of  planets  for  the  annual  chart  of  Example
118.

(1) Only Moon is in the prescribed house (the 3rd house in Moon’s case). He gets 5

units.

(2) No planet is in exaltation or own sign.
(3) Venus in 1st, Mercury in 2nd, Moon in 3rd are the feminine planets in prescribed

houses. Jupiter in 4th is in the masculine planet in the prescibed house.

(4) Because  the  new  year  started  at  4:42  am,  i.e.  during  the  night,  we  give  5  units

each to the feminine planets – Moon, Mercury, Venus and Saturn.

Adding all the sources, we get 15 for Moon, 10 for Mercury and Venus, 5 for Jupiter
and Saturn and zero for Sun and Mars.

28.4  Pancha Vargeeya Bala

Panchavargeeya81 bala is found using the following procedure:

81 Pancha means “five”. Pancha vargeeya means “from the group of five”.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

377

28.4.1  Kshetra Bala

Kshetra bala shows the  strength in rasi chart. A  planet in own rasi  gets 30 units of
Kshetra bala. A planet in a friend’s rasi gets 15 units of Kshetra bala. A planet in an
enemy’s rasi gets 7.5 units of Kshetra bala.

28.4.2  Uchcha Bala

Uchcha bala shows how close a planet is from its exaltation point. A planet gets 20
units  of  uchcha  bala  if  it  is  at  its  deep  exaltation  point  (Sun:  10º  Ar,  Moon:  3º  Ta,
Mars:  28º  Cp,  Mercury:  15º  Vi,  Jupiter:  5º  Cn,  Venus:  27º  Pi,  Saturn:  20º  Li).  At
180º from its deep exaltation point, a planet is deeply debilitated and it gets 0 units of
uchcha bala.

We  can  find  the  longitude  difference  between  a  planet’s  position  and  its  deep
debilitation point and divide it by 180º to get the fraction that shows how far away it
is  from  its  debilitation  point.  Bu  multiplying  20  units  with  this  fraction,  we  get
uchcha bala.

For example, suppose Jupiter is at 8Vi30 (8°30' in Vi). So he is at 158°30' from the
start  of  the  zodiac.  His  debilitation  point  is  5°  in  Cp,  i.e.  275°0'.  The  difference  is
275°0' – 158°30' = 116°30'. Because this is less than 180°, we don’t have to subtract
it from 360°.

Now  116°30'/180°  =  0.6472.  Multiply  20  with  this  fraction,  we  get  12.94.  So
Jupiter’s uchcha bala is 12.94 (out of 20).

28.4.3  Hadda Bala

Each  rasi  is  divided  into  several  haddas  and  different  haddas  have  different  lords.
Hadda is similar to D-30. Table 72 can be used for finding the hadda lords of planets.

Hadda  bala  shows  the  strength  in  hadda.  A  planet  in  own  hadda  gets  15  units  of
Hadda bala. A planet in a friend’s hadda gets 7.5 units of Hadda bala. A planet in an
enemy’s hadda gets 3.75 units of Hadda bala.

  378

28.4.4  Drekkana Bala

Drekkana bala shows the strength in drekkana chart (D-3). A planet in own rasi in D-
3  gets  10  units  of  Drekkana  bala.  A  planet  in  a  friend’s  rasi  in  D-3  gets  5  units  of
Drekkana bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-3 gets 2.5 units of Drekkana bala.

28.4.5  Navamsa Bala

Navamsa bala shows the strength in navamsa chart (D-9). A planet in own rasi in D-
9  gets  5  units  of  Navamsa  bala.  A  planet  in  a  friend’s  rasi  in  D-9  gets  2.5  units  of
Navamsa bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-9 gets 1.25 units of Navamsa bala.

28.4.6  Final Computation

We  find  the  sum  of  kshetra  bala,  uchcha  bala,  hadda  bala,  drekkana  bala  and
navamsa bala and divide the sum by 4. The result is called “Pancha Vargeeya Bala”.
If it is below 5, the planet is weak. If it is between 5 and 10, the planet has ordinary
strength. If it is between 10 and 15, the planet is strong. If it is between 15 and 20,
the planet is very strong. If it is above 20, the planet is extraordinarily strong.

28.5  Dwaadasa Vargeeya Bala

Consider the twelve divisional charts: D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-5, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-9,
D-10, D-11, and, D-12.

A planet is strong in a chart if it is in its exaltation rasi or its own rasi or a rasi owned
by a friend. A planet is weak in a chart if it is in its debilitation rasi or a rasi owned
by an enemy. Out of the 12 charts above, count the charts in which a planet is strong
and  count
is  weak.  The  difference  gives
Dwadasavargeeya82 bala. If a planet is strong in more charts, it is strong overall. If a
planet is weak in more charts, it is weak overall.

28.6  Lord of the Year

Varsheswara  or  lord  of  the  year  is  the  most  important  planet  during  the  year.  His
dasa brings important results. The following are the candidates:

(1) Lord of the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the annual chart, based on whether

the new year starts during the day or the night

82 Dwaadasa means “twelve”. Dwaadasavargeeya means “from the 12 groups”.

If a candidate is strong as per panchavargeeya bala and has a benefic aspect on lagna,
it becomes the lord of the year.

After the five candidates are found, the candidates having a benefic aspect on lagna
are  short-listed.  Out  of  those,  the  planet  having  the  highest  panchavargeeya  bala
becomes  the  lord  of  the  year.  If  two  candidates  have  similar  panchavargeeya  bala,
the one becoming a candidate in more of the five categories listed above becomes the
lord of the year.

If  none  of  the  planet  has  a  benefic  aspect  on  lagna,  even  a  malefic  aspect  may  be
accepted. If none of the planets has an aspect on lagna, we may take a candidate that
is very strong as per panchavargeeya bala.

If none of the candidates has a strong aspect on lagna and none of the candidates is
very strong as per panchavargeeya bala, then we may take the first candidate (lord of
the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the annual chart, based on whether the new year
starts during the day or the night).

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

381

Example  120:  Let  us  consider  the  annual  chart  in  Example  118.  Let  us  find  the
candidates for the lord of the year:

(1)  The  new  year  started  at  4:41  am,  i.e.  night  time.  So  we  should  take  Moon  and
find the lord of the rasi occupied by him. Moon is in Pisces owned by Jupiter. So
Jupiter gets the first candidacy.

(2)  Natal lagna is in Leo. So Sun gets the second candidacy.
(3)  Muntha is in Taurus. So Venus gets the third candidacy.
(4)  Lagna in the annual chart is in Capricorn. So Saturn gets the fourth candidacy.
(5)  Triraasi lord for lagna in Cp at night time is Mars, from Table 73. So Mars gets

the fifth candidacy.

The candidates are – Jupiter, Sun, Venus, Saturn and Mars. Of those, Venus occupies
lagna and Jupiter and Saturn have a square aspect on lagna. All of them are malefic
aspects. Sun has a semi-sextile aspect, which is neutral. Mars has a sextile aspect on
Capricorn  lagna  from  Pisces.  He  is  also  has  the  strongest  panchavargeeya  bala
(13.7). So we conclude easily that Mars is the lord of the year.

28.7  Lord of the Month

We find the lord of the month in a monthly chart in the same manner. We have six
candidates now:

(1) Lord of the rasi occupied by Sun or Moon in the monthly chart, based on whether

the new month starts during the day or the night

(2) Lord of natal lagna
(3) Lord of Muntha
(4) Lord of lagna in the monthly chart
(5) Triraasi lord of lagna in the monthly chart (see Table 73)
(6) Lord of the year

The rest of the rules are the same.

28.8  Sahams

28.8.1  Calculation

Sahams  are  the  significant  points  in  the  zodiac  related  to  specific  matters.  For
example,  “raajya”  means  kingdom  and  “raajya  saham”  is  a  significant  point  in  the
zodiac  related  to  obtaining  kingdom.  “Paradesa”  means  a  foreign  country  and
“paradesa  saham”  is  a  significant  point  in  the zodiac  related  to  going  abroad.  Each
saham has a formula that looks like A – B + C. What this means is that we take the
longitudes of A, B and C and find (A – B + C). This is equivalent to finding how far
A is from B and then taking the same distance from C. However, if C is not between
B and A (i.e. we start from B and go zodiacally till we meet A and we do not find C
on the way), then we add 30º to the value evaluated above.

For example, finding (Moon – Sun + Lagna) is equivalent to finding how far Moon
is from Sun and taking the same distance from lagna. If we start from the longitude
of Sun and go zodiacally till the longitude of Moon and do not find lagna on the way,
then we have to add 30º. The list of important sahams is given in Table 74. For most
sahams, the formula given as (A – B + C) is for daytime charts. For nighttime charts,
it changes to (B – A + C). This will not be explicitly mentioned for each saham and a
mention will be made only when there is a difference.

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Example 121: Let us consider the annual chart of Example 118 and find artha saham
(money), samartha saham (enterprise/ability) and vanik saham (commerce).

Let us use the formulas given in Table 74. Formula of artha saham is: 2nd house – 2nd
lord  +  Lagna.  Because  the  chart  is  cast  for  the  night  time,  we  should  reverse  the
formula.  However,  as  the  note  in  parantheses  after  the  formula  says,  this  formula
should  be  used  for  both  day  &  night.  Lagna  is  at  10  Cp  50,  i.e.  280°50'.  The  2nd
house is at 10 Aq 50, i.e. 310°50'. Lord of the 2nd house is Saturn and he is at 19 Ar
10, i.e. 19°10'. So artha saham = 310°50' – 19°10' + 280°50' = 572°30'. We can add
or subtract multiples of 360º from a longitude to reduce it to the range 0º to 360º. By
subtracting  360º,  we  get  212°30'.  This  means  that  artha  saham  is  at  212°30'.  This
means  2°30'  in  Sc  or  simply  2  Sc  30.  Now  we  have  to  check  whether  the  C  is
between  B  and  A  in  A  –  B  +  C.  We  have  to  check  whether  lagna  (280°50')  is
between 2nd lord (19°10') and 2nd house (310°50'). It is – if we start from 19°10' and
go till 310°50', we do encounter 280°50' on the way. So we don’t have to add 30º.

Formula  of  samartha  saham  is:  Mars  –  Lagna  Lord  +  Lagna.  Because  this  chart  is
cast  for  night  time,  we  should  make  it  Lagna  Lord  –  Mars  +  Lagna.  Lagna  lord
Saturn  is  at  19  Ar  10,  i.e.  19°10'.  Mars  is  at  24  Pi  58,  i.e.  354°58'.  Lagna  is  at
280°50'. So samartha saham = 19°10' – 354°58' + 280°50' + 360º. We added 360º to
make the result positive. We can always add and subtract multiples of 360º from any
longitude. So samartha saham is 305°2'. If we start from 354°58' and go zodiacally
till  we  reach  19°10'  (when  we  reach  the  end  of  Pisces,  we  go  to  Aries),  we  do  not
encounter  280°50'.  So  lagna  is  not  between  Mars  and  lagna  lord.  So  we  add  30º.
Samartha saham is finally at 335°2', i.e. at 5°2' in Pi or simply 5 Pi 02.

Formula of vanik saham is: Moon – Mercury + Lagna. Because this chart is cast for
night time, we should make it Mercury  – Moon  +  Lagna. Moon is  at 15  Pi 14, i.e.
345°14'.  Mercury  is  at  11  Aq  28,  i.e.  311°28'.  Lagna  is  at  280°50'.  So  samartha
saham  =  311°28'  –  345°14'  +  280°50'.  So  vanik  saham  is  247°4'.  If  we  start  from
345°14' and go zodiacally till we reach 311°28' (when we reach the end of Pisces, we
go  to  Aries),  we  cover  a  large  arc  of  about  330º.  On  the  way,  we  do  encounter
280°50'.  So  lagna  is  between  Moon  and  Mercury.  So  we  don’t  have  to  add  30º.
Vanik saham is at 247°4', i.e. at 7°4' in Sg or simply 7 Sg 04.

28.8.2  Use of sahams

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

385

If there are good yogas in an annucl chart involving the lord of the rasi containing an
important  saham  and  lagna  lord,  then  important  events  related  to  the  matter  of  the
saham may materialize during the year.

We can also use sahams in natal charts. When Saturn or Rahu transits close to natal
paradesa saham or jalapatana saham, for example, one may go abroad. When Jupiter
occupies or aspects natal vivaha saham in transit, one may get married. Thus we can
use sahams in natal charts also.

NOTE: In western astrology, there are Arabian parts (e.g. part of fortune) which are
similar  to  sahams.  In  fact,  there  are  a  lot  of  similarities  between  the  techniques  in
Tajaka system and western astrology.

Some  people  may  suggest  that  Indians  learnt  Tajaka  system  from  Arabs.  This  is
possible.  However,  one  must  note  that  astrology  as  practiced  in  India  is  much
superior  in  width  and  depth  to  astrology  practiced  in  any  other  part  of  the  world.
Indian  astrology  is  a  big  superset  of  which  different  astrological  traditions  of  the
world  are  but  small  subsets.  One  may  speculate  that  Vedic  astrology  as  taught  by
Parasara,  Jaimini,  Manu  etc  was  very  exhaustive  in  scope  and  experts  in  different
branches of it traveled to different parts of the world in ancient times to establish the
knowledge there.

29.  Tajaka Yogas

29.1  Introduction

Just  as  we  have  yogas  in  natal  charts,  we  have  special  combinations  with  special
results that are applicable to Tajaka annual/monthly charts. These are called Tajaka
yogas.  These  yogas  are  applicable  to  Tajaka  annual  charts  as  well  as  prasna  charts
(horary charts). We will briefly go over their definitions in this chapter.

29.2  Definitions

29.2.1

Ishkavala Yoga

If planets occupy only kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses) and panapharas (2nd, 5th,
8th  and  11th  houses)  and  if  apoklimas  (3rd,  6th,  9th  and  12th  houses)  are  empty,  then
this yoga is present. This yoga gives wealth, happiness and good fortune.

29.2.2

Induvara Yoga

If planets occupy only apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses) and if kendras (1st, 4th,
7th and 10th houses) and panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses) are empty, then this
yoga is present. This yoga gives disappointments, worries and illnesses.

29.2.3

Ithasala Yoga

If two planets have an aspect and if the faster moving planet83 is less advanced in its
rasi than the slower moving planet, then we have an ithasala yoga between the two.
In western astrology, this is called an “applying aspect”.

83  In  the  increasing  order  of  speed,  planets  can  be  listed  as:  Saturn,  Rahu/Ketu,  Jupiter,  Mars,  Sun,
Venus, Mercury and Moon.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

387

Results: This is a good yoga and this shows fulfillment of the matters represented by
the  two  planets  in  ithasala.  Suppose  we  want  to  analyze  prospects  for  a  particular
matter.  Then    ithasala  involving  lagna  lord,  lord  of  the  related  house,  lord  of  the
related  saham  or  the  naisargika  karaka  (natural  significator)  will  show  good  results
related  to  the  matter.  For  example,  ithasala  between  lagna  lord  and  7th  lord  (or  the
lord of vivaha saham or Venus) shows that the native may get married in the year.

Example: Suppose Moon is at 14º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li. They have a sextile
aspect.  Both  the  planets  are  within  the  deeptaamsa  (orb)  of  the  other.  Moon’s
advancement  in  his  rasi  is  14º  and  Venus’s  advancement  in  his  rasi  is  19º.  Faster
planet (Moon) is less advanced than the slower planet (Venus). So we have ithasala
yoga.

Types of Ithasala: There are 3 types of ithasala yoga.

(i) Vartamaana ithasala yoga results when the planets aspect each other and both are
within the deeptaamsa (orb) of the other planet. Vartamaana means present (current).
In the above example, Venus is at 19º and his deeptaamsa extends from 12º to 26º.
Moon  is  within  his  deeptaamsa.  Venus  is  also  within  Moon’s  deeptaamsa.  So  we
have vartamaana ithasala.

(ii) Poorna ithasala yoga results when the planets aspect each other closely and their
advancements in respective rasis are within 1º of each other. Poorna means complete.
Poorna  ithasala  is  the  most  powerful  ithasala.  It  shows  speedy  fulfillment  of  the
matter. In the above example, the difference between the advancements of Moon and
Venus in respective rasis is 19º–14º = 5º. This is more than 1º. So we don’t have a
poorna ithasala. Now let us say that Moon is at 18º25' in Le (instead of 14° in Le).
Then  also  we  have  an  ithasala  because  Moon  is  behind  Venus.  The  difference
between  the  advancements  is  only  0°35',  i.e.  less  than  1°.  So  we  have  a  poorna
ithasala now.

(iii)  Bhavishya  ithasala  yoga  is  formed  if  vartamaana  ithasala  yoga  is  about  to  be
formed when the faster moving planet moves by 1º or less. Bhavishya means future.
Bhavishya  ithasala  shows  fulfillment  after  some  obstructions  or  delay.  Suppose
Moon  is  at  13°35'  in  Le  and  Venus  is  at  21º20'  in  Le.  There  is  a  sextile  aspect.
Moon’s deeptaamsa is 12º and hence his sextile aspect on  Li  extends from 1º35' to
25º35'  in  Li  (subtract  and  add  12º,  Moon’s  deeptaamsa,  from/to  13º35').  Venus  is
within Moon’s deeptaamsa. However, Moon is just outside the deeptaamsa of Venus,

  388

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

as the deeptaamsa of Venus’s sextile aspect on Le extends from 14º20' to 28º20' in Li
(subtract  and  add  7º,  Venus’s  deeptaamsa,  from/to  21º20').  Moon  is  at  13°35'  and
this  is  outside  Venus’s  deeptaamsa.  So  there  is  no  vartamaana  (present)  ithasala.
However, when Moon is the faster planet and he needs to move by just 0°45' (which
is  less  than  1º)  to  come  to  14°20'.  Once  he  comes  to  14°20',  he  is  within  the
deeptaamsa of Venus’s aspect on Le and we have a vartamaana ithasala yoga. So we
have a bhavishya (future) ithasala yoga when Moon is at 13°35' in Le.

Special Notes: One should understand the meaning of these combinations and apply
them  intelligently.  The  main  criterion  of  ithasala  is  that  the  faster  moving  planet
should be behind. This means that the two planets will reach the same advancement
in  their  rasis  and  have  an  exact  aspect  (sookshma  drishti)  very  soon.  If  Moon  is  at
14º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li, Moon is going to reach 19º very soon and Moon
and  Venus  are  going  to  have  an  exact  sextile  aspect.  So  the  energies  of  Moon  and
Venus are soon going to work in unison.

That is the main idea behind ithasala. If the faster moving planet is retrograde, then
the  above  is  not  going  to  happen  and  we  no  longer  have  ithasala.  For  example,
suppose retrograde Mercury is at 18º in Ge and Mars is at 18°10' in Li. One may be
tempted  to  think  that  there  is  an  extremely  powerful  trinal  aspect  and  a  poorna
ithasala yoga because the difference in advancements is merely 0°10'. However, that
is  not  correct.  Being  retrograde,  Mercury  will  go  backward  and  Mars  will  go
forward.  They  are  not  going  to  reach  the  same  longitude  anytime  soon.  Despite
indications of success, one may be dogged with failure under this combination.

On the other hand, if the slower planet is retrograde, there is no problem. It, in fact,
shows a faster realization, as the two planets will reach the same advancement faster.
Suppose Moon is at 18º in Ar and retrograde Mercury is at 24º in Ge. Now both the
planets  move  towards  the  other  planet  and  they  are  going  to  reach  the  same
advancement soon. So there is an ithasala yoga.

Suppose  the  faster  moving  planet  is  retrograde  and  it  is  more  advanced  in  its  rasi
than the slower moving planet. In that case, one may be tempted to think that there is
no ithasala yoga. However, both the planets move towards the other and so there is
an  ithasala  yoga.  However,  a  planet’s  speed  reduces  under  retrogression  and  the
difference in advancements has to be smaller. For example, suppose Mars is at 21º in
Cp  and  retrograde  Mercury  is  at  23º  in  Vi.  They  have  a  trinal  aspect.  One  may  be
tempted  to  think  that  there  is  no  ithasala  here,  because  Mercury,  who  moves  faster

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

389

than Mars, is more advanced in his rasi. However, being retrograde, Mercury moves
backward. Very soon, Mars and Mercury are going to have the same advancements
in  respective  rasis  (perhaps  near  22º).  They  will  have  an  exact  aspect  then.  So  we
have an ithasala yoga.

Thus one should adapt the rules in the case of retrogression. Even when there is no
retrogression, some changes may have to be made. Suppose Mercury is at 18º in Vi
and Mars is at 18°45'  in Cp and neither is retrograde. Then one may be tempted to
think  that  there  is  a  poorna  ithasala  yoga  in  their  trinal  aspect.  Now  suppose  that
Mercury is about to become retrograde and he will become retrograde after reaching
18°05'. In that case, Mercury and Mars are not going to have an exact aspect anytime
soon,  because  Mercury  will  start  going  backward  after  reaching  18°05'.  So  there  is
no ithasala.

Thus  an  erudite  astrologer  should  make  proper  modifications  to  the  rules  when  a
planet is retrograde or about to become retrograde.

29.2.4  Eesarpha Yoga

Easarpha yoga is the opposite of ithasala. If two planets have an aspect and the faster
moving  planet  has  a  higher  advancement  in  its  rasi  than  the  slower  moving  planet,
then we have eesarpha yoga.

Results: This is a bad yoga. This results in failures and disappointments. If lagna lord
has eesarpha yoga with 5th lord or putra saham lord or Jupiter, some disappointments
related to children are possible. If lagna lord has an eesarpha with 10th lord or 5th lord
or raajya saham lord or Sun in the chart of a president or prime minister or king, loss
of power is a possibility during the year.

Example: Suppose Moon is at 23º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li. They have a sextile
aspect.  Both  the  planets  are  within  the  deeptaamsa  (orb)  of  the  other.  Moon’s
advancement  in  his  rasi  is  23º  and  Venus’s  advancement  in  his  rasi  is  19º.  Faster
planet  (Moon)  is  more  advanced  than  the  slower  planet  (Venus).  So  we  have
eesarpha yoga.

Special Notes: We made some comments under ithasala yoga about planets that are
retrograde  or  about  to  become  retrograde.  If  the  faster  moving  planet  is  retrograde
and  less  advanced  in  its  rasi,  then  we  have  eesaarpha  yoga.  If  the  faster  moving

  390

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

planet in an aspect is retrograde and more advanced in its rasi, then we do not have
eesarpha yoga. We have an ithasala yoga instead.

29.2.5  Nakta Yoga

Suppose two planets have an aspect, but there is no ithasala yoga or eesarpha yoga.
Then, we say that there is Nakta yoga between the two planets, if a planet that moves
faster  than  both  the  planets  has  an  aspect  with  both  and  forms  ithasala  yoga  with
both. This shows fulfillment of the matters represented by the first 2 planets with the
help of someone shows by the 3rd planet.

Example: Suppose lagna is in Ta and Venus is at 13º in Ge. Suppose 7th lord Mars is
in Sc (7th itself) at 15º. They have no aspect. Now suppose Moon is at 11º in Cn. He
has a semi-sextile aspect with Venus and a trinal aspect with Mars. He has a lower
advancement in his rasi (11º) than the other two planets and hence he has an ithasala
yoga  with  the  two  planets.  Thus,  Venus  and  Mars  have  Nakta  yoga  between  them.
Because Venus is lagna lord in 2nd (family) and Mars is the 7th lord in 7th, this yoga
shows getting married in the year. This may happen with the help of someone shown
by Moon. As Moon owns the 3rd house, this may show the involvement of younger
brother  or  sister.  For  example,  the  native  may  marry  a  friend  of  his  younger  sister
with her help.

29.2.6  Yamaya Yoga

Suppose two planets have an aspect, but there is no ithasala yoga or eesarpha yoga.
Then,  we  say  that  there  is  Yamaya  yoga  between  the  two  planets,  if  a  planet  that
moves slower than both the planets has an aspect with both and forms ithasala yoga
with  both.  This  shows  fulfillment  of  the  matters  represented  by  the  first  2  planets
with the help of someone shows by the 3rd planet, after obstacles and delays.

Example: Suppose lagna is in Ta and Venus is at 13º in Ge. Suppose 7th lord Mars is
in Sc (7th itself) at 15º. They have no aspect. Now suppose Jupiter is at 16º in Cn. He
has a semi-sextile aspect with Venus and a trinal aspect with Mars. He has a higher
advancement in his rasi (16º) than the other two planets and hence he has an ithasala
yoga with the two planets. Thus, Venus and Mars have Yamaya yoga between them.
Because Venus is lagna lord in 2nd (family) and Mars is the 7th lord in 7th, this yoga
shows getting married in the year. This may happen with the help of someone shown

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

391

by Jupiter. As Jupiter owns the 11th house, this may show the involvement of elder
siblings or friends.

29.2.7  Manahoo Yoga

Suppose two planets have an ithasala yoga. If Saturn or Mars is in conjunction with
the faster moving planet and stays within the deeptaamsa of the latter, then Manahoo
yoga results. This yoga cancels the ithasala yoga and gives failures, disappointments,
quarrels, loss of wealth etc.

Suppose  Jupiter  is  at  21º  in  Pi  and  Moon  is  at  18º  in  Cn,  then  they  have  a  sextile
aspect and an ithasala yoga, because Moon (18º) is behind Jupiter (21º). However, let
us  say  that  Saturn  is  at  19º  in  Cn.  Then  Saturn  cancels  the  ithasala  between  Moon
and Jupiter and gives bad results.

If Mars or Saturn is one of the two planets in ithasala yoga, then we obviously need
the other planet to give Manahoo yoga.

Notes: Some people suggest that an aspect of Saturn or Mars within the deeptaamsa
of  the  faster  moving  planet  is  sufficient  to  give  Manahoo  yoga.  In  the  above
example,  Saturn  need  not  be  in  Cn  according  to  this.  Saturn  or  Mars  in  6º-30º
(Moon’s deeptaamsa) in Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Cp, Pi, Ar, Ta and Ge will have an aspect
with  Moon  –  faster  moving  planet  in  Moon-Jupiter  ithasala  –  within  Moon’s
deeptaamsa.  So  Manahoo  yoga  results.  However,  readers  are  advised  to  consider
only  conjunction. Some  authors have suggested that both Mars and Saturn must be
involved, but one of them is enough to spoil ithasala yoga and give Manahoo yoga.

29.2.8  Kamboola Yoga

Suppose two planets have an ithasala yoga. If Moon has an ithasala with one of the
planets (or both), then we have Kamboola yoga. This yoga adds power to the ithasala
yoga. The power added varies based on the strength of Moon and other planets.

Suppose Mars is at 23º in Sc and Jupiter is at 26º in Pi. Then they have a trinal aspect
and  an  ithasala  yoga.  Now,  suppose  Moon  is  at 22º  in  Le.  He  has  an  ithasala  yoga
with  Mars.  So  we  have  Kamboola  yoga  and  Mars-Jupiter  ithasala  becomes  more
powerful because of it.

  392

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

29.2.9  Gairi-Kamboola Yoga

If  Moon  is  in  the  last  degree  of  a  rasi  and  he  will  form  ithasala  with  one  of  the
planets in an ithasala after moving to the next rasi, it is called Gairi-Kamboola yoga.
It is essentially Kamboola yoga in waiting. Moon must also form an ithasala with a
strong planet for this yoga to be effective. Moreover, Moon should not be exalted or
debilitated  or  occupy  his  own  navamsa,  drekkana  or  hadda.  This  yoga  shows
realization of the matter with help from others, after some delay.

Suppose Mars is at 1º in Cp, Jupiter is at 2º in Pi and Venus is at 3° in Li. Mars and
Jupiter  have  a  sextile  aspect  and  ithasala  yoga.  Suppose  Moon  is  at  29°10'  in  Vi.
Moon  is  in  the  last  degree  of  Vi.  Moon  is  in  Mercury’s  navamsa  (Vi),  Venus’s
drekkana (Ta) and Saturn’s hadda. Moon has no ithasala with Mars or Jupiter, but he
will  have  ithasala  with  Mars  as  soon  as  he  moves  to  Li.  He  also  has  ithasala  with
Venus, who is very strong. So we have Gairi-Kamboola yoga.

29.2.10  Khallasara Yoga

If lagna lord is in the rasi between Moon and another planet X without ithasala with
either planet, then Khallasara yoga results. This yoga destroys the signification of X.

Suppose lagna is in Vi, Moon is at 1º in Ar, lagna lord Mercury is at 15º in Ta and
Jupiter  is  at  29º  in  Ge,  then  Khallasara  yoga  is  formed.  Lagna  lord  Mercury  is
between  Moon  and  Jupiter  and  there  is  no  ithasala  with  Moon  or  Jupiter.  The
significations  of  Jupiter  are  destroyed  and  there  may  be  some  disappointments
related to mother, education, house, vehicles or marriage.

29.2.11  Radda Yoga

If an ithasala yoga involves a planet in debilitation or retrogression or combustion or
otherwise weak, it turns into Radda  yoga. This  yoga negates ithasala and gives bad
results.

About  planets  in  retrogression,  one  should  remember  the  comments  made  under
ithasala yoga. If retrograde Mercury is at 5º in Vi and Mars is at 7º in Sc, there is no

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

393

ithasala.  Whether  one  calls  it  Eesarpha  or  Radda  yoga  depends  on  one’s
interpretation, but the results are going to be bad in either case.

Suppose  lagna  is  in  Ar,  Saturn  is  at  20º  in  Ar  and  Mars  is  at  15º  in  Sg.  Then  they
have  an  ithasala  yoga.  However,  Saturn  is  debilitated.  So  ithasala  turns  into  radda
and bad results are indicated. Because Saturn owns the 10th and 11th houses, they can
be related to career and material gains.

29.2.12  Duhphali-Kutta Yoga

If  (a)  the  faster  planet  in  an  ithasala  is  exalted  or  occupies  own  rasi  or  has  a  good
panchavargeeya  bala  and  (b)  the  slower  planet  is  not  exalted,  not  in  own  rasi  and
weak in panchavargeeya bala, then it goes by a special name – Duhphali-Kutta yoga.
This yoga shows realization of ambitions and dreams.

Suppose Saturn is at 20º in Li with a good panchavargeeya bala and Mars is at 18º in
Ge  with  a  low  panchavargeeya  bala,  then  they  have  an  ithasala  yoga.  Because
Saturn, the slower planet, is exalted and strong and Mars, the faster planet, is weak,
this becomes Duhphali-Kutta yoga.

29.2.13  Duttota Yoga

If two planets in an ithasala are weak (debilitated or occupying inimical rasis, having
a  low  panchavargeeya  bala)  and  one  of  them  has  an  ithasala  yoga  with  a  strong
planet (exalted or occupying own rasi, having a high panchavargeeya bala), then we
have Duttota yoga.

This yoga gives good results.

Suppose  lagna  is  in  Ar,  Saturn  is  at  20º  in  Ar  and  Mars  is  at  19º  in  Li.  Then  they
have  an  ithasala  yoga.  However,  Saturn  is  debilitated.  So  ithasala  turns  into  radda
and bad results are indicated. Now, suppose Venus is at 18º in Pi. Saturn has a semi-
sextile aspect and an ithasala yoga with exalted Venus. So the final result is Duttota
yoga and good results are promised. Because Saturn owns the 10th and 11th houses,
they can be related to career and material gains.

29.2.14  Thambira Yoga

  394

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

If a planet is in the last degree of a rasi and it forms ithasala yoga after moving to the
next  rasi  with  a  slower  moving  planet,  it  is  called  Thambira  yoga.  This  shows
realization of hopes after delay and hard work.

Suppose lagna is in Ar, Mars is at 2º in Le and Venus is at 29°10' in Ta. Venus has
no ithasala with Mars. However, when Venus moves to Ge, he will have an ithasala
with  Mars.  So  Venus  forms  Thambira  yoga  with  Mars.  This  shows  good  events
related to family and marital life after some hard work.

29.2.15  Kutta Yoga

If  a  planet  occupying  lagna  is  aspected  by  a  planet  in  occupying  own  or  exaltation
rasi in a kendra or a panaphara, then this yoga is formed. The desires related to the
matters signified by the planet in lagna are fulfilled.84

Suppose lagna is in Ta, Sun is at 21º in Ta and Mercury is at 16º in Vi. Mercury is
exalted in a panaphara and aspects Sun in lagna. So Sun gives Kutta yoga and the 4th
house matters receive a boost in the year.

29.2.16  Durupha Yoga

Ithasala given by two planets in dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th house) in combustion or
retrogression  or  debilitation  turns  into  Durupha  yoga.  The  planets  are  powerless  to
give any good results.

Suppose  lagna  is  in  Ar.  Suppose  Mars  is  at  15º  in  Cn  and  Saturn  is  at  17º  in  Ar.
Because both Mars and Saturn are debilitated, their ithasala turns into Durupha yoga.
Mars and Saturn cannot give good results related to career and gains.

29.3  Conclusion

One should remember the definitions of all the yogas and consider all of them. There
is some overlap between some yogas here. An ithasala may be converted to another

84 This yoga was interpreted differently by scholars.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

395

yoga if an additional combination is present and it may again turn into another yoga
under yet another combination. So it is possible to overlook one planet and conclude
the presence of a wrong yoga.

30.  Annual Dasas

30.1  Introduction

We  have  studied  different  dasa  systems  that  enable  us  to  time  events  in  a  person’s
life. In the previous few chapters, we have seen how Tajaka annual charts show the
fortune in a one-year period. The next question is – how do we time events shown in
a Tajaka  annual chart? For example, an annual chart may show that the native will
get married in the year. The question is – when in the year will (s)he get married?

All the dasas covered earlier are valid for natal charts and their paramayush is of the
order of 100  years. On the other hand,  an annual chart  applies only for a period of
one year. So we need dasas that are compressed to a one-year period. We will learn 3
dasas  in  this  chapter:  (1)  Patyayini  dasa85  mentioned  by  Tajaka  writers,  (2)  Mudda
dasa or Varsha Vimsottari dasa, and, (3) Varsha Narayana dasa.

In  Vimsottari  dasa  and  Narayana  dasa,  paramayush  of  120  years  is  compressed  to
one  year.  One  may  try  finding  compressed  Vimsottari  dasa  based  on  Moon’s
constellation  in  the  annual  chart,  but  the  best  results  are  obtained  by  progressing
Moon’s constellation in the natal chart at the rate of one  constellation per  year  and
using it to initiate dasas. Similarly, one may try  finding compressed Narayana dasa
based on lagna in the  annual chart, but the best  results are obtained by progressing
lagna in the natal chart at the rate of one sign per year and using it as lagna for the
purpose of Narayana dasa86.

Example 122: Let us consider a lady born on 1st June 1972 at 4:16 am (IST) at 81 E
12, 16 N 15. She got married on 24th July 1993. Let us time this event from 1993-94
annual chart using all the 3 dasas.

Varsha pravesh data: 1st June 1993, 1:30:04 pm (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 15. Rasi and
navamsa charts of this data are given in Chart 67.

85 Dr. B.V. Raman simply called this “Varsha dasa” (annual dasa).
86 This is a result of the author’s own researches.

vivaha saham lord Jupiter in it. Lagna lord Mercury is in own sign and has ithasala
with  Jupiter.  In  navamsa,  7th  lord  Mercury  is  well-placed.  Lagna  lord  Jupiter  joins

  398

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Venus in the 2nd house of family. All these factors brought marriage in the year. We
will time it using different dasas now.
30.2  Patyayini Dasa

This  dasa  is  based  on  the  longitudes  of  lagna  and  all  planets  and  it  is  specifically
meant for Tajaka charts.

Procedure:

(1) Consider lagna and the seven planets. Find their advancement from the beginning
of the respective signs occupied by them. Arrange them in the ascending  order.
These are called “Krisamsas” of planets.

(2) Leave  the  krisamsa  of  the  first  planet  (the  one  with  the  lowest  value).  From
krisamsas of all other planets, subtract the krisamsas of the previous planets.  In
other  words,  subtract  the  krisamsa  that  is  just  below  the  current  planet’s
krisamsa. These values are called “Patyamsas”.

(3) Dasas of lagna and the seven planet are in the order found in (1). Their dasas are
in the ratio of their patyamsas. Dasa of a planet (in days) is given by the formula:

365.2425 x (its patyamsa / sum of all patyamsas87)

(4) To  find  antardasas,  we  use  the  same  ratios  and  order  used  in  dasas,  just  as  in
Vimsottari dasa. First antardasa is the same as dasa. Then we go in the order.

For the annual chart in Example 122, we can find the longitudes of planets and lagna
in Chart 67. We can arange them in the ascending order and find the ratios as shown
in Table 75.

We see that the first 25 days (June 1-26, 1993) is Venus dasa. Next 48 days (June 26-
Aug 13, 1993) is Mercury dasa. And so on.

The  first  antardasa  in  Venus  dasa  belongs  to  Venus  himself.  Its  length  is  0.0684  x
24.98 days = 1.7 days. Next antardasa belongs to Mercury and the length is 0.1319 x
24.98 = 3.3 days. Next antardasa belongs to Moon and the length is 0.0014 x 24.98 =
0.03 days (i.e. less than an hour). Next antardasa belongs to Saturn and the length is

87 It may be noted that the sum of all patyamsas is nothing but the largest krisamsa.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

399

0.0705  x  24.98  =  1.8  days.  We  can  find  all  the  antardasas  in  all  the  dasas  in  this
manner.

Timing of marriage:

Mercury dasa ran during June 26-Aug 13, 1993. This was the dasa that was running
when she got married on 24th July 1993. Why did Mercury give marriage?

(1) Mercury is lagna lord.
(2) He is very strong as per panchavargeeya bala.
(3) He is varsheswara (lord of the year).
(4) He aspects vivaha saham within 3º.
(5) In navamsa, which is the right chart for marriage, he is the 7th lord. He is strong

in a trine. Lagna and 7th lords in navamsa can certainly give marriage.

30.3  Mudda Dasa (Varsha Vimsottari Dasa)

Dasa length:

This is essentially Vimsottari dasa with 120 years compressed to a solar year. If we
take a solar year to be of 360 days, with each day corresponding to the time period in
which Sun moves by exactly 1º, we get the dasa of days of a planet by multiplying
normal  dasa  years  by  3.  For  example,  Sun  dasa  is  normally  for  6  years.  By
compressing 120 years to 360 solar days, we find Sun’s Varsha Vimsottari dasa to be
6 x 3 = 18 days. Durations of all dasas are given in Table 76 (in solar days).

Dasa order:

To  initiate  dasas,  we  should  progress  Moon’s  natal  constellation  at  the  rate  of  one
constellation per  year and use the resulting constellation. Instead of progressing the
constellation, we can also do the following:

Consider (1) Sun, (2) Moon, (3) Mars, (4) Rahu, (5) Jupiter, (6) Saturn, (7) Mercury,
(8) Ketu and (9) Venus.

Take  the  number  corresponding  to  the  lord  of  Moon’s  natal  constellation  (i.e.  the
lord of the first Vimsottari dasa in natal chart). Add the number of completed years
to  this  number.  Divide  the  number  by  9  and  take  the  remainder.  See  the  planet
corresponding to that number. First dasa belongs to that planet. After that, dasas will
follow the normal order. Remainder of 0 is equivalent to 9 and hence shows Venus.

In  Example  122,  natal  Moon  is  in  Uttaraashaadha  constellation.  So  the  first  dasa
belongs to Sun. The number corresponding to Sun is 1. Number of completed years
is 1993-1972=21. Adding 1 and 21, we get 22. Dividing it by 9, we get a quotient of
2 and a remainder of 4. That shows Rahu.

Dasa balance:

For finding the dasa balance, the fraction of the natal Moon’s constellation yet to be
traversed is taken.

In Example 122, natal Moon is at 29 Sg 28. About 0.79 of the constellation is yet to
be  traversed  by  natal  Moon.  So  the  balance  in  Rahu’s  Varsha  Vimsottari  dasa  of
1994-94 is 0.79 x 54 solar days = 42.66 solar days. So June 1-July 14, 1993 is Rahu
dasa. Jupiter dasa runs for 48 days then.

Timing of marriage:

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

401

Jupiter is 7th lord and vivaha saham lord in rasi chart. He is in lagna. In navamsa, he
is lagna lord and occupies the 2nd house of family with Venus.

It may, however, be noted that Mercury is a better candidate for giving marriage, for
the  reasons  mentioned  earlier.  Patyayini  dasa  shows  the  event  better  than  Mudda
dasa.

30.4  Varsha Narayana Dasa

Dasa durations:

This is essentially Narayana dasa compressed from 120 years88 to 360 solar days. If a
rasi’s dasa is of n years, it becomes 3 x n solar days after compression, i.e. a period in
which Sun moves by (3 x n)º.

Dasa order:

We  find  the  dasa  order  in  Narayana  dasa  of  rasi  chart  and  Narayana  dasa  of
divisional  charts  just  as  in  natal  charts.  The  only  difference  is  that  we  should
progress natal lagna and use it, instead of lagna in the annual chart.

Just  as  we  progress  Moon  by  one  constellation  per  year  when  finding  Varsha
Vimsottari  dasa,  we  progress  lagna  by  one  rasi  per  year  when  finding  Varsha
Narayana  dasa.  In  other  words,  we  take  muntha  as  lagna  when  finding  Varsha
Narayana dasa. This is the link between the natal chart and the Tajaka chart.

Let  us  take  Example  122  and  find  Varsha  Narayana  dasa  of  D-9.  Natal  lagna  is  in
Aries. Because the native started the 22nd  year in 1993, we find the 22nd house, i.e.
the 10th house (after removing 12), from Ar and get muntha in Cp.

We  now  find  Varsha  Narayana  dasa  assuming  that  lagna  in  rasi  chart  is  in  Cp.  To
find Narayana dasa of D-9, we need the 9th lord in rasi chart. Vi is the 9th from Cp
and Mercury owns it. He is in Sc in navamsa and Sc is stronger than Ta. So we start
dasas from Sc. Normally the dasa order should have been Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li etc.

88 Sum of the 2 cycles of Narayana dasa for natal charts is 12 x 12 = 144 years. However, only the
first 120 years of this is valid, as the paramayush of human beings is 120 years.

  402

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

But  Saturn  is  in Sc  and the  “Saturn  exception”  applies.  So  dasas  go  as  Sc,  Sg,  Cp,
Aq, Pi, Ar etc.

Sc, Sg, Cp and Aq dasas are of 7, 4, 2 and 3 years respectively. After compressing to
one  year,  they  are  of  21,  12,  6  and  9  solar  days  respectively.  This  covers  48  solar
days and these dasas run from June 1-July 20, 1993. Pisces dasa of 33 days started
then and it brought marriage.

Why Pisces dasa? Well, it contains lagna in D-9 and has subhaargala from lagna lord
Jupiter and Venus. Navamsa lagna’s dasa as per Varsha Narayana dasa of navamsa is
an ideal candidate for bringing marriage.

Exercise 48: A native born on 4th April 1970 at 5:50 pm (IST) at 81 E 12, 16 N 15
got  married  on  1st  August  1993.  Verify  that  navamsa  lagna’s  dasa  as  per  varsha
Narayana  dasa  of  navamsa  was  running  at  the  time  of  marriage.  Verify  that  the
running  dasa  and  antardasa  as  per  Patyayini  dasa  and  Mudda  dasa  –  at  the  time  of
wedding – belonged to lagna/7th lord in rasi/navamsa.

Usually Patyayini dasa gives better results than Mudda dasa. Varsha Narayana dasa
is, however, the best dasa for Tajaka annual charts. So we will see more examples of
Varsha Narayana dasa.

Example  123:  The  native  of  Exercise  48  went  from  India  to  US  for  his  masters
degree  in  engineering,  on  15th  August  1991.  He  went  on  a  fellowship  from  a
University in US. Let us time his foreign trip using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-4.

Varsha pravesh data: 5th April 1991, 3:05:33 am (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 15

In rasi chart, lagna has Saturn and Rahu. Both the planets show living away from the
place of birth. Jupiter owns 12th – living away from homeland – and he is exalted in
7th – a long trip. In D-4 (see Chart 68), 9th and 12th lord Mercury is in 7th showing a
long  trip  to  a  foreign  land.  Mars  owns  7th  (long  trips)  and  he  is  in  9th.  Sun  owns
paradesa saham and jalapatana saham and he is in 12th – foreign lands – in D-4. For
all these reasons, the native went abroad during the year.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

403

Chart 68

Though rasi chart has lagna in Cp, muntha or annual progressed ascendant is in Ge.
We should use Ge as lagna for Varsha Narayana dasa. The 4th house from Ge is Vi
and Mercury owns it. He is in Ar in D-4. Ar with two planets is stronger than Li with
one planet. Dasas go as Ar, Ta, Ge Cn etc.

Virgo  dasa  was  running  during  August  10-26,  1991.  The  native  went  abroad  on
15th/16th August 1991, during Virgo dasa, Gemini antardasa as per Varsha Narayana
dasa  of  D-4.  Virgo  is  the  12th  house  containing  the  lord  of  padesa  saham  and
jalapatana saham. Gemini is the 9th house containing 7th lord. Lord of both Virgo and
Gemini is Mercury and he is in the 7th house.

Example  124:  The  native  of  Exercise  48  stood  State  First  in  Intermediate
(Secondary School) examinations in the AP state of India on 28th May 1987 and he
was selected for  Indian  Institute of Technology (India’s top engineering school) on
1st June 1987. Let us time this academic success using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-
24.

Varsha pravesh data: 5th April 1987, 2:15:41 am (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 15

  404

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Vidya saham lord Mars is in the 5th house in rasi chart. He is in own sign in D-24,
which  shows  education  (see  Chart  69).  He  is  in  the  3rd  house  from  AL  in  D-24,
showing material success (in education, as this is in D-24).

Chart 69

Muntha is in Aq in rasi chart. Taking Aq as lagna, 12th house is Cp. Its lord is Saturn.
He  is  in  Ar  in  D-24  and  Ar  is  stronger  than  Li.  So  Varsha  Narayana  dasa  of  D-24
goes  as  Ar,  Ta,  Ge,  Cn  etc.  Cn  dasa  runs  during  May  26-June  17,  1987.  This  dasa
brought academic success. Why?

(1) Cn contains lagna lord and shows prosperity to the matters signified by the chart,

i.e. education.

(2) It is the 11th from AL  and shows  gains in status (of  course, only in the field of

education).

(3) Its lord Moon is in the 5th house from it.
(4) The  5th  house  from  it  has  a  very  strong  Mars,  who  is  in  own  sign.  Moreover,

Mars owns vidya saham and occupies 5th in rasi chart.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

405

Example 125: The native of Exercise 48 had a son on 21st August 1998. Let us time
this using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-7.

Varsha pravesh data: 4th April 1998, 9:59:49 pm (IST), 81 E 12, 16 N 15

Chart 70

In rasi chart, lagna is in Sc and putra saham is in Ar. Lord Mars is in 5th house. D-7
shows children. In D-7, Jupiter owns 5th and he aspects 5th from 11th (see Chart 70).
This resulted in a son in the year.

Muntha is in Cp in rasi chart. The 7th house is in Cn. Moon owns it. Moon is in Cp in
D-7 and Cp is stronger than Cn. So Narayana dasa of D-7 starts from Cp and goes as
Cp, Sg, Sc, Li etc.

Ge dasa of 24 solar days started just before the birth of son. Why did Ge give a child
in its D-7 Varsha Narayana dasa?

  406

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(1) Ge is the 11th house in D-7, showing happiness related to children.
(2) Ge has Jupiter, the significator of children.
(3) Ge has Jupiter, the 5th lord who aspects 5th.
(4) The  3rd  house  is  the  11th  from  5th  and  shows  childbirth.  Its  exalted  lord  Venus

aspects Ge.

(5) Mars owns putra saham and he aspects Ge.
(6) Putra pada (arudha pada of 5th) aspects Ge from Vi.

Gemini is a clear candidate simply because it is 11th and 5th lord Jupiter occupies it.

Exercise  49:  Given  that  the  native  of  Exercise  48  bought  a  car  in  1995-96,  try  to
time it using Varsha Narayana dasa of D-16.

30.5  Conclusion

In  this  chapter,  we  learnt  three  dasa  systems  that  are  applicable  to  Tajaka  annual
charts. Patyayini dasa is applicable to Tajaka monthly charts also. For annual charts,
Varsha  Narayana  dasa  and  Patyayini  dasa  give  the  best  results.  If  a  result  seems
likely  in  an  annual  chart,  we  can  find  the  exact  month  or  week  of  the  event  using
these dasas.

is  in  the  4th  from  Venus.  Jupiter  owns  3rd  and  shows  expenditure  on  4th,  i.e.
expenditure  on  account  of  happiness  from  vehicle.  He  is  exalted  in  the  4th  from
Venus showing a good vehicle. Muntha is in Li and Cp is the 4th. Saturns owns it and
occupies Vi in D-16. Pi is stronger than Vi. So dasas go as Pi, Cn, Sc, Sg, Ar, Le etc.

Cancer dasa in the second cycle ran during Jan 16-Feb 9, 1996. The native bought a
car in this dasa.

31.  Sudarsana Chakra Dasa

31.1  Introduction

Parasara  said  that  Sudarsana  Chakra  dasa  was  taught  by  Brahma  –  the  Creator  –
Himself and that it is a great tool for predicting  daily, monthly  and annual fortune.
Because  the  calculations  necessary  for  Sudarsana  Chakra  dasa  interpretation  are  an
integral  part  of  casting  Tajaka  annual,  monthly  and  sixty-hour  charts,  this  dasa  is
being  covered  in  the  part  on  “Tajaka  Analysis”  rather  than  the  part  on  “Dasa
Analysis”. However, it should be borne in mind that this is a dasa applicable to natal
charts. This is just a natal dasa like Vimsottari dasa, Narayana dasa and Kalachakra
dasa.

Chart 72

31.2  Sudarsana Chakra

In  each  chart,  there  are  3  important  reference  points:  (1)  lagna,  (2)  Moon,  and,  (3)
Sun. Lagna represents the physical body. Moon represents the mind. Sun represents
the soul. The three together represent one’s self. We should consider houses from all
the three reference points when judging a chart. For example, we need to look at the
10th  house  from  lagna,  Moon  and  Sun  to  see  career.  Though  we  typically  give
importance to lagna, all the three references are important.

To  symbolically  represent  this,  we  can  draw  Sudarsana  Chakra  (SC)  as  taught  by
Parasara.  We  should  draw  3  concentric  circles.  We  should  write  down  the  bhava
chakra with respect to lagna, Moon and Sun in the inner, middle and outer charts. To
illustrate this, let us take the rasi chart given in Chart 72. Sudarsana Chakra for this
chart is given in Figure 4.

The 10th house from lagna is in Sg and it has Ketu. The 10th house from Moon is Sc
and it is empty. The 10th house from Sun is Aries and it is empty. We should analyze
all the 3 factors together to draw conclusions.

31.3  Dasa Computation

Dasas of the 12 houses run in cycles throughout a native’s life. Each dasa is for one
year. For example, dasa of the 1st house runs in the 1st year of one’s life. Dasa of the
2nd house runs in the 2nd year of one’s life. After 12 years, dasa of the 1st house will
return in the 13th year. Dasa of the 2nd house will return in the 14th year. After every
12 years, the same dasas keep coming.

One  year  stands  for  a  solar  year  here.  A  new  dasa  starts  after  every  one  year.  The
exact  date  and  time  when  a  new  SC  dasa  starts  can  be  found  by  casting  Tajaka
annual chart. Look at the number of years completed. Adding one to it, you get the
year  that  starts.  Divide  it  by  12  and  find  the  remainder  (if  the  remainder  is  zero,
make it 12). This remainder gives the house whose dasa runs in the year.

For example, let us take a native who finishes 44 years and starts the 45th year of his
life  on  a  particular  date.  Because  the  remainder  when  45  is  divided  by  12  is  9,  SC
dasa of the 9th house runs in the 45th year.

  410

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

When we say dasa of the 9th house here,  we mean the 9th house  from lagna, Moon
and Sun. If lagna is in Pi, Moon is in Aq and Sun is in Cn, then the 9th house is in Sc,
Li and Pi.

However, analyzing with 3 signs becomes difficult. So one may conveniently choose
the  strongest  reference  out  of  lagna,  Moon  and  Sun  and  take  dasas  from  it.  This  is
only an approximation, but it simplifies analysis.

Figure 4: Sudarsana Chakra

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

411

Antardasas:

Each dasa is divided into 12 antardasas. Take the dasa sign as lagna and give the 1st,
2nd, 3rd etc houses from it to antardasas.

If Pi is natal lagna, dasa in the 45th year belongs to the 9th house, i.e. Sc. Antardasas
in this dasa go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc.

We can use Tajaka monthly charts to find the date and time when an antardasa starts.

Similarly,  we  can  find  pratyantardasas  from  antardasas  and  use  Tajaka  sixty-hour
charts to find the date and time when a pratyantardasa starts.

In  short,  Tajaka  annual,  monthly  and  sixty-hour  charts  are  nothing  but  the  entry
charts  of  dasas,  antardasas  and  pratyantardasas  as  per  Sudarsana  Chakra  dasa.
Muntha in Tajaka annual charts is nothing but the dasa sign as per Sudarsana Chakra
dasa,  but  always  reckoned  from  lagna.  If  we  redefine  muntha  to  be  the  progressed
from the strongest of lagna, Moon and Sun (instead of always from lagna), it exactly
becomes the SC dasa sign.

We can find Sudarsana Chakra dasa for divisional charts also. We take the strongest
of lagna, Moon and Sun and then start SC dasa from there. It moves at the rate of one
house per year. Examples will make this clear.

31.4  Dasa Interpretation

To interpret a dasa (or antardasa or pratyantardasa), we have to take the dasa sign (or
antardasa  sign  or  pratyantardasa  sign)  as  lagna  and  analyze  the  planetary  positions
with respect to it. What planetary positions do we mean – natal or transit?

Some  people  may  prefer  to  analyze  the  natal  positions,  but that  would  suggest  that
one gets the same results after every 12 years. That is not logical.

Parasara  clearly  advised  that  we  have  to  analyze  the  planetary  positions  at  the
commencement  of  a  dasa  (or  antardasa  or  pratyantardasa)  with  respect  to  the  dasa
sign (or antardasa sign or pratyantardasa sign). This is where Tajaka charts fit in.

  412

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

If  benefics  are  in  quadrants,  trines  and  8th  from  dasa  sign,  favorable  results  can  be
expected. Benefics in houses other than the 6th and 12th houses produce good results
for the houses they occupy. Malefics in the 3rd, 6th and 11th houses bring good results.
Malefics  in  other  houses  spoil  the  results  of  the  houses  they  occupy.  In  particular,
Rahu destroys the house he occupies.

Example 126: Let us revisit Example 124. In the natal chart, lagna and Moon are in
Ge in D-24. In 1987-88, the native ran the 18th year of his life. So SC dasa of the 6th
house was running. The 6th house from Ge is Sc. So Scorpio dasa was running as per
Sudarsana  Chakra  dasa  of  D-24.  We  should  look  at  planetary  positions  w.r.t.  Sc  at
the time this dasa started, i.e. in Tajaka annual chart of the year (see Chart 69).

Benefics  Mercury,  Jupiter  and  Venus  are  in  5th,  8th  and  9th  respectively  and  all  of
them are good placements. Malefics Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are in 6th, 11th and 11th
respectively and all of them are good placements. Moreover, dasa sign Sc houses a
powerful raja yoga involving the 1st, 9th and 10th lords from it.

For all these reasons, this year was excellent for matters shown in D-24.

Though  Sudarsana  Chakra  dasa  can  be  found  for  all  divisional  charts,  pay  special
attention to rasi chart. Here is an example.

Example  127:  Indira  Gandhi’s  natal  rasi  chart  and  Tajaka  annual  chart  of  1976-77
are given in Chart 73. During that year, Indira Gandhi’s party lost the Parliamentary
Elections and she was removed from the post of India’s Prime Minister.

Because  the  finished  years  are  1976-1917  =  59,  we  should  add  1  and  divide  60  by
12. Remainder is 12 and Sudarsana Chakra dasa during the year belongs to the 12th
house. Compared to lagna and Moon, Sun with Budha-Aaditya yoga is stronger. Let
us take the 12th from Sun. It is Libra.

Libra’s SC dasa runs during the  year and we should look at the planetary positions
from Libra in the Tajaka annual chart (or dasa commencement chart). Benefic Venus
is in 3rd giving failures. Rahu afflicts the 1st house. Mars, Sun and Mercury are not
well-placed  in  the  2nd  house.  Saturn  afflicts  the  10th  house  showing  troubles  in
career.

Part 4: Tajaka Analysis

413

Chart 73

  414

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Because  of  bad  placement  of  planets  (especially  Saturn  and  Rahu),  Sudarsana
Chakra does not promise a good year. No wonder Mrs. Gandhi fell from power.

Example  128:  Let  us  consider  the  lady  of  Chart  74.  She  got  married  in  January
1999. Let us analyze her Sudarsana Chakra dasa of navamsa for 1998-99.

She was born in 1973 and she started her 26th year in July 1998. If we divide 26 by
12, we get a remainder of 2. So SC dasa in 1998-99 belongs to the 2nd house. In natal
navamsa, lagna is in Cn and it is stronger than Moon and Sun. The 2nd house from
Cn is Le. So Le dasa was running in 1998-99. Is it a good dasa?

Three benefics are in quadrants and 3 malefics are in 3rd/11th. Though Mars is in 9th,
he  is  strong  being  in  own  house.  Most  planets  are  favorably  placed  and,  more
importantly, lagna and 7th are strong with Jupiter and Venus in them (respectively).
So this was a favorable year for matters shown by D-9. No wonder she got married.

31.5  Conclusion

Parasara called Sudarsana Chakra dasa a very important dasa. It, however, needs to
be understood better.

Sudarsana  Chakra  dasa  is  interpreted  based  on  the  planetary  positions  at  the
commencement  of  a  dasa  or  an  antardasa  or  a  pratyantardasa.  Those  planetary
positions  can  be  found  from  Tajaka  annual  or  monthly  or  sixty-hour  charts.  In
addition, muntha defined in Tajaka texts is nothing but Sudarsana Chakra dasa rasi
reckoned  from  lagna.  So  there  may  be  some  missing  links  between  Sudarsana
Chakra dasa and Tajaka analysis.

Sudarsana  chakra  dasa  is  good  at  showing  favorable  and  unfavorable  periods  in  a
general sense.

Some speical topics will be covered in this part.

When  one  uses  Vedic  astrology  at  its  fullest  glory,  it  is  very
systematic and leads to very precise  predictions. However, we
need a very accurate birthtime. In  real life, however,  we often
get  erroneous  data.  Coping  with  birthtime  errors  is  a  very
important topic.

In  an  effort  to  promote  rational  thinking  in  the  astrological
community, a chapter on rational thinking is included.

What  is  the  use  of  diagnosing  one’s  disease,  if  the  diease
cannot  be  remedied?  Similarly,  what  is  the  use  of  making
intelligent  guesses  about  future,  if  we  cannot  do  something
about  undesirable events  that  are  likely  to  happen?  The  basics
of remedial measures are introduced in the chapter on remedial
measures.

Making  predictions  about  groups  of  people,  like  nations,  is
much  more  complicated
than  making  predictions  about
individuals.  Some  basic  techniques  are  introduced  in  the
chapter on mundane astrology.

Muhurta  or  electional  astrology  is  an  important  branch  of

Vedic astrology is not a mundane subject like mathematics and

astrologers  are  required  to  be  spiritually  aware  and  observe
some ethics. These are addressed in a small chapter.

32.  Impact of Birthtime Error

32.1  Introduction

There are twins in this world who are born 1-2 minutes apart, but live significantly
different lives. There may be some similarities between closely born twins, but there
can be significant differences too.89 So this proves that divisional charts and special
lagnas, which change very fast, have a  great bearing on a native’s fortune.  If one’s
birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes, lagna and special lagnas in some divisional charts
change  and  so  the  results  change.  This  is  how  we  can  explain  the  differences
between twins.

Now  the  question  is  —  if  changes  in  lagna  and  special  lagnas  in  divisional  charts
explain  the  different  fortunes  of  twins,  what  about  people  who  don’t  have  a  twin?
Well,  the  same  thing  applies  to  them.  If  we  analyze  the  chart  cast  with  a  birthtime
that is wrong by 2 minutes, we are no longer examining the chart of the native – we
are simply looking  at the chart of his hypothetical twin! The results predicted need
not be true.

Lagna in D-1 changes rasi once in 2 hours. Some people make predictions only using
D-1,  but  that  is  unscientific  and  against  the  teachings  of  maharshis.  Due  to  divine
powers  and  God-given  intuition,  one  can  be  successful  in  one’s  predictions  only
using  D-1,  but  that  is  clearly  unscientific.  We  should  see  different  areas  of  life  in
different  divisional  charts,  as  taught  by  Maharshi  Parasara.  When  we  do  that,  we
need an accurate birthtime. If one’s birthtime is between 9:02 am and 9:08 am, can
we  make  accurate  predictions  using  an  average  of  9:05  am?  No!  Many  people  are
born  within  the  small  span  of  6  minutes  (between  9:02  and  9:08)  and  they  can  be
significantly  different  from  each  other  (e.g.  twins).  Applying  precise  techniques  is
pointless when we only have an approximate time. So let us conclude that we must

89  In  order  to  explain  the  differences  between  twins,  some  astrologers  take  the  lagna  of  the  second
twin in the 3rd house (younger brother) from the first twin. If Aquarius is rising at the birth of both,
they  take  Aries  (3rd  from  Aquarius)  as  the  lagna  of  the  younger  twin.  This  is,  however,  illogical,
irrational and against the teachings of maharshis. One who understands what lagna means and what
the rasi chart shows will reject such theories without any consideration at all.

Part 5: Special Topics

421

first make sure that we are working with an accurate birthtime. Readers should
remember that our analysis could be only as accurate as our data!

We are often told by clients that their birthtime is very accurate. However, it is this
author’s  experience  that  birthtimes  reported  by  people  are  seldom  accurate.  There
can  be  various  reasons  behind  a  birthtime  error:  (1)  using  an  unadjusted
clock/wristwatch  showing  a  slightly  incorrect  time,  (2)  forgetting  to  note  the
birthtime  exactly  after  birth  and  noting  down  it  a  little  later  with  some  manual
correction  applied  to  compensate  for  the  lapse,  (3)  wrong  memory  of  mother  or
father when giving the correctly noted birthtime to an astrologer, (4) using the wrong
definition of ‘birth’.

Birthtime  rectification  is  the  process  of  correcting  the  reported  birthtime  before
proceeding to make predictions based on the birthtime. There are some formulas in
literature  for  birthtime  rectification,  but  these  assume  that  human  births  happen  in
certain quanta. For example, an approach may assume that nobody is born during a
period of 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a minute then. Then
again,  nobody  is  born  for  3  minutes  and  people  can  be  born  in  a  period  of  half  a
minute following it. Like this, time is divided into certain quanta in which people can
be born. Then we find the nearest “human birth can happen now” quantum from the
reported birthtime and use it as the rectified (corrected) birthtime.

Out  of  these  methods,  some  of  the  reasonable  methods  are  the  ones  based  on  (a)
Tattva siddhaanta, (b) Pranapada lagna in navamsa, and, (c) Kunda. The first method
beyond the scope of this book and the other two fail the acid test of twins. If we were
to  apply  those  methods  to  the  charts  of  twins  born  2  minutes  apart,  the  rectified
birthtimes of the two twins would be either the same or too far apart.

In  essence,  most  of  the  birthtime  rectification  techniques  described  in  literature  do
not  work.  The  only  correct  way  to  rectify  a  birthtime  is  to  find  a  time  in  the
neighborhood of the reported birthtime so that we can explain the nature, credentials,
attitude and aptitude of the native and the known events from the native’s past. This
is a laborious process, but there is no other way.

Suppose we  are told that one was born between  9:02 and 9:08 am and suppose we
are looking at his chart. Because we don’t know the exact birthtime, we can look at a
range.  If we do that, we are potentially looking  at thousands of people born during
that time. Our native could be anyone among thousands of people born in that range.

  422

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

But all those thousands  of people have significant differences. We want  to identify
our native among those thousands of people and the only way is to look at the known
past. That’s the only thing that distinguishes him from others born closely.

So we should look at 9:02, 9:03, 9:04 etc and see which one explains the known past
better.  The  rectified  birthtime  is  the  birthtime  with  which  the  known  life  events  of
the native make sense.

32.2  Robustness of Computations

When  we  try  different  birthtimes,  all  the  computations  change.  If  we  know  how
various  computations  are  altered  based  on  small  changes  in  the  birthtime,  we  can
approach  the  problem  of  birthtime  rectification  intelligently.  We  will  discuss  the
approximate impact of birthtime change on various computations.

32.2.1  Divisional Charts

Planets:

Positions  of  planets  in  rasi  chart  and  divisional  charts  change  very  slowly.  For
example, Sun stays in one rasi for 30 days. He changes rasi in D-10 once in 30/10=3
days. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 30/24=1.25 days. The speed of Mercury,
Venus and Mars is comparable to Sun’s. Jupiter and Saturn are even slower. Moon is
faster than all these planets. He stays in one rasi for 2.5 days or 60 hours. He changes
rasi in D-10 once in 60/10=6 hours. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 60/24=2.5
hours.

If  the  uncertainty  in  birthtime  is  of  the  order  of  5  minutes  or  10  minutes,  one  may
think that there is no problem with these planets as they stay in the same rasi in all
divisional charts for a lot longer time than 5-10 minutes. However, if a planet is at a
border and changes rasi in a divisional chart during those 5 minutes, we have to take
that into consideration. Suppose Moon is is at 23Sc59. Suppose That places him in
the 8th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Aq. Suppose lagna in D-10 is Cn. So D-10 has lagna lord
in 8th. This makes the D-10 chart weak. On the other hand, it Moon is at 24Sc00 or
above, he will be in the 9th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Pi. This puts lagna lord in 9th in D-10
and the chart is strengthened. Because Moon moves by one quarter of a nakshatra (or
200 arc-min) in 6 hours (or 360 min), he takes 360/200=1.8 min to move by 1 arc-

Part 5: Special Topics

423

min. For Moon to go from 23Sc59 to 24Sc00, it only takes about 2 minutes.90 If we
cannot rule out an error of 2 minutes, we should consider Moon in both Aq and Pi
and see which one explains the native’s career better.

Thus, we should pay attention if any planet is at a rasi border in the divisional chart
of interest. If so, we must consider both the positions and see which one makes better
sense based on known past.

Lagna:

Lagna  changes  rasi  in  divisional  charts  much  faster  than  planets.  So  it  is  the  most
important consideration in birthtime rectification.

Lagna  moves  by  one  rasi  (30º)  in  2  hours  or  120  min.  To  move  by  1º,  lagna  takes
about 4 min.

Lesson:  Lagna  moves  by  1º  in  4  min.  Lagna  moves  by  10'  in  2/3  min  (or  40
seconds). Lagna moves by 1' in 4 sec. Lagna moves by 10'' in 2/3 sec.

We can see that lagna changes rasi in D-10 in 12 min. It changes rasi in D-24 in 5
min.

Example  129:    Suppose  we  are  told  that  someone  was  born  at  9:05  am.  Suppose
lagna is at 4Sg39. Suppose we have events related to D-10 (career), D-12 (parents)
and D-24 (education). Lagna at 4Sg39 puts lagna in these 3 charts in Cp, Cp and Sc
(respectively). Suppose the birthtime is reasonably accurate and the maximum error
is 5 minutes (i.e. birthtime can be 9:00-9:10). Let us find the possible lagnas in the 3
charts.

An  error  of  5  min  changes  lagna  by  about  5/4=1.25º  or  1º15'.  So,  instead  of  being
4Sg39,  it  can  be  as  low  as  3Sg24  or  as  high  as  5Sg54.  So  we  should  consider  all
lagnas between 3Sg24 and 5Sg54. In D-10, lagna changes rasi at multiples of 3º. So
the  whole  range  we  have  for  lagna  results  in  the  same  D-10  lagna  (Cp).  In  D-12,

90 We are assuming here that our computation of Moon’s longitude is very accurate. There are some
unresolved controversies like (1) ayanamsa and (2) geocentric positions vs topocentric positions. Due
to these controversies,  we cannot be confident of our calculations. It is prudent to consider both the
rasis in border-line situations.

  424

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

lagna changes rasi at multiples of 2º30'. So we have a transition at 5º. So there  are
two possibilities for lagna – one in 3Sg24-5Sg00 and the other in 5Sg00-5Sg54. So
lagna in D-12 can be Cp or Aq. Lagna in D-24 changes rasi at multiples of 1º15'. It
changes  rasi  at  3º45'  and  5º00'.  So  we  have  3  possibilities  for  lagna  –  (1)  3Sg24-
3Sg45: Li, (2) 3Sg45-5Sg00: Sc, (3) 5Sg00-5Sg54: Sg.

Using  these  sets  of  lagnas,  we  should  analyze  the  charts  and  see  which  one  makes
sense. Suppose Sg lagna in D-24 and Aq lagna in D-12 explain known events. But
suppose  we  cannot  explain  his  career.  Suppose  Aq  lagna  instead  of  Cp  lagna
explains his career well. Then what do we do?

To get the next rasi as D-10 lagna (Aq instead of Cp), we should cross the next D-10
border,  which  is  6Sg00.  So  the  lagna  should  become  6Sg00  (or  higher)  instead  of
4Sg39. So we have to add 1º21' or higher to lagna. Lagna moves by 1º21' or 81' in
81x4 sec = 324 sec = 5 min 24 sec.

This means that the birthtime should be 9:10:24 instead of 9:05. Though we are told
that  the  error  in  birthtime  cannot  be  more  than  5  minutes,  it  has  to  be  more  than  5
minutes in this case to explain known facts.

Please  note  that  these  calculations  are  made  on  the  assumption  that  lagna  moves
uniformly. That is not the case in reality. So the actual rectified birthtime may be a
little  off.  We  can  do  approximate  calculations  first  and  then  see  if  it  has  to  be
corrected further. For example, we may get lagna at 9:10:24 to be 5Sg59 instead of
the expected value of 6Sg00. Then we have to add a few more seconds and see if we
cross 6Sg00.

One  may  see  from  this  example  that  an  astrologer  should  know  the  details  of  the
computation of divisional charts and be familiar with the longitudes at which lagna
changes  rasi  in  various  divisional  charts.  That  familiarity  is  a  necessity  for  quick
birthtime rectification.

Special Lagnas:

Hora lagna moves twice as fast as lagna. Ghati lagna moves 5 times as fast as lagna.

Lesson:

Part 5: Special Topics

425

HL moves by 1º in 2 min. HL moves by 10' in 1/3 min (or 20 seconds). HL moves by
1' in 2 sec. HL moves by 10'' in 1/3 sec.

GL  moves  by  1º  in  4/5  min  (or  48  seconds).  GL  moves  by  10'  in  4.8  seconds.  GL
moves by 1' in 0.48 sec (less than half a second).

Exercise 50: Suppose someone is born at 9:05 am and has GL at 20Le37. This puts
GL  in  D-10  in  Aq.  Suppose  we  expect  the  D-10  GL  in  Ar  to  explain  the  native’s
periods of power and authority. What should the correct birthtime be?

Rasi dasas based on rasi chart change only if lagna changes rasi or a planet changes
rasi.  Because  lagna  changes  rasi  once  in  2  hours,  we  do  not  have  to  deal  with
inaccuracies in rasi dasas in most cases.

Narayana dasa of divisional charts does not change in a small period of time, unless
a planet changes rasi in the divisional chart of interest.

However,  the  dasa  start  dates  in  nakshatra  dasas  change  with  small  changes  in
birthtime.  Let  us  say  the  complete  duration  (and  not  just  the  remainder  at  birth)  of
the dasa running at birth is n years. Let us say the birthtime is wrong by m minutes.
Moon stays in the nakshatra for about 24x60 minutes (24 hours) and the error in the
fraction of Moon’s constellation that is yet to be traversed is m/(24x60). The error in
the number of days of dasa left is nx360xm/(24x60) = (n x m)/4. If we add m minutes
to the birthtime, we should subtract (n x m)/4 days from dasa dates and vice versa.

If 7  years of Venus dasa remains at birth, then n = 20 and the approximate error in
dasa  dates  is  20m/4  =  5m  days,  where  m  is  the  birthtime  error  in  minutes.  If  the
birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes, dasa dates are wrong by 10 days.

If the birthtime is wrong by 2 minutes and 3 years of Moon dasa were remaining at
birth, then n = 10 and m = 2 and the error in dasa dates is 10x2/4 = 5 days.

In Kalachakra dasa, the error is more.  If n  years is the paramayush of the sequence
corresponding to the navamsa of natal Moon and m minutes is the error in birthtime,

  426

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

the error in the dates of dasa is (n x m) days. If we add m minutes to the birthtime, we
should subtract (n x m) days from dasa dates and vice versa.

For  example,  if  the  paramayush  is  100  years  and  the  birthtime  error  is  2  minutes,
then the error in dates is 200 days. It is almost 7 months!

For  this  reason,  it  is  futile  to  use  pratyantardasas  in  Kalachakra  dasa  unless  one  is
absolutely confident of the birthtime.

32.2.3  Tajaka Charts

If the change in lagna in the natal chart due to a birthtime change is x, then the lagna
in  the  Tajaka  annual  and  monthly  charts  will  also  change  by  approximately  x.
However, we have to keep in mind that the list of divisional charts in which lagna is
near rasi borders may change.

For  example,  let  us  say  that  natal  lagna  is  at  23Sc30  and  lagna  in  a  Tajaka  annual
chart  for  1980-81  is  at  15Cn05.  Let  us  say  that  the  birthtime  can  have  an  error  of
upto 3 minutes (either way – plus or minus). Let us say that we are interested in the
career of the native and especially in an event in career that took place in 1980-81. In
natal  D-10,  lagna  (23Sc30)  is  in  the  middle  of  the  8th  dasamsa  in  Sc.  Unless  the
birthtime changes by more than 6 minutes in either direction, lagna in D-10 will not
change. However, lagna in 1980-81 Tajaka annual chart is close to a dasamsa border.
If lagna is just below 15º in Cn, lagna in D-10 will be in the 5th from Pi. i.e. Cn itself.
If lagna is just above 15º in Cn, lagna in D-10 will be in the 6th from Pi, i.e. Le. With
the given birthtime, we get 15Cn05 and so lagna in D-10 in the Tajaka chart is in Le.
But it could be Cn if the native’s birth took place half a minute before the reported
birthtime.

Thus, sometimes we cannot detect a birthtime error just by looking at the natal chart
and dasas. Looking at the divisional charts of Tajaka annual charts can help in some
cases.

The assumption here is that one casts Tajaka charts very accurately. This is not true
with those who use the approximate method taught in this boo or those who find the
exact  solar  return  but  use  an  approximate  formula  for  Sun’s  motion  or  use  a  linear
formula for ayanamsa.

Part 5: Special Topics

427

The actual ayanamsa used matters only to a small extent, in the sense that it has the
same  impact  on  the  longitude  of  lagna  and  the  rasis  occupied  by  lagna  in  various
divisional charts, as it has in the natal chart. On the other hand, using an approximate
linear  formula  for  ayanamsa  brings  minor  discrepancy  in  Sun’s  longitude  which  is
multiplied by 360 in the longitude of lagna. This results in  a serious error. Though
we do not know exactly when Nirayana zodiac coincided with the Sayana zodiac, we
do know the exact nonlinear formula of the precession. So one hoping to use Tajaka
charts  in  birthtime  rectification  must  use  the  correct  nonlinear  formula  of  the
ayanamsa  of  one’s  choice.  Unfortunately,  many  people  use  linear  approximations.
They are not good enough for Tajaka charts.

32.3  A Practical Approach

It is a good idea to first determine the correct D-9 lagna or D-10 lagna and then go to
the  other  divisional  charts.  We  should  first  determine  that  the  birthtime  is  between
9:05 and 9:15. Then we can determine that it is between 9:07 and 9:11. Then we can
use a more precise criterion and narrow down further. Thus we narrow down further
and further with each criterion.

If one’s marriage has already taken place, we can use D-9 to see it and fix D-9 lagna.
If not, we can see one’s general sense of duty, one’s basic skills and one’s interaction
with others and fix D-9 lagna based on them. Then we can go to a higher divisional
chart. However, in reality, sometimes it may become necessary to come back to D-9.
For example, suppose someone can have lagna in D-9 in Li or Sc. Suppose we think
that Li is also a good candidate but Sc is better. Then the candidates for D-24 lagna
that we get with this choice may not make sense. It may make sense to place lagna in
D-24 in another rasi and that may require lagna in D-9 to be in Li. In that case, we
can revisit D-9 and change the lagna.

Trying  to  first  do  a  broad  rectification  with  D-9  and  D-10  and  then  doing  a  fine
rectification with high divisional charts like D-20 and Kalachakra dasa will provide a
systematic  approach  to  the  problem,  but  we  should  be  willing  to  come  back  to  the
first step if we are stuck in the second step.

After a couple of examples, this approach may become clearer.

  428

32.4  Practical Examples

Example  130:  Let  us  consider  a  gentleman  whose  birthdata  is  reported  as:  30th
November 1966, 10:36 am (IST), 77 E 47, 11 N 19. His D-4 and D-9 are shown in
Chart 75 and his D-10 and D-24 are shown in Chart 76.

Lagna  with  the  reported  birthtime  is  at  13Cp16.  Let  us  approach  the  problem  of
rectification in a pyramid-like approach. First let us verify D-4 lagna. The native left
his motherland and went to USA in Jupiter dasa. In D-4, Jupiter owns 9th (flourishing
abroad) and 12th (staying away from motherland) and he occupies the 7th house (long
journeys). Rahu is the primary significator of foreign residence and he joins Jupiter.
For these reasons, Jupiter dasa can certainly take him abroad. So lagna in D-4 is most
probably correct.

D-4  lagna  changes  rasi  at  multiples  of  7.5º.  The  lagna  we  used  above  (13Cp16)  is
between  7.5º  and  15º  in  Cp.  So  we  conclude  that  lagna  is  between  7Cp30  and
15Cp00.

Next,  let  us  look  at  navamsa.  In  navamsa,  lagna  changes  rasi  at  multiples  of  3º20'.
Here is changes at 13Cp20. The given lagna (13Cp16) is just below it. We see from
Chart 75 that navamsa lagna is in Ar. However, with a very small error, it can be Ta
also. Let us consider both.

If  we  take  navamsa  lagna  in  Ar,  the  native  should  be  dynamic  (Ar),  spiritual  and
possibly short-tempered (Ketu). With Venus and Moon in trines, he should be skilled
at singing or other arts. But he isn’t. With Mercury in the 2nd house, he should be a
skilled speaker. However, he isn’t really a skillful speaker.

If we take navamsa lagna in Ta, the native should be a hard-working and sincere (Ta)
intellectual  (Mercury).  He  should  be  mild-mannered,  liked  by  most  people  and
learned  in  many  subjects  (Mercury).  This  description  fits  the  native  better.  So
probably lagna is above 13Cp20.

Part 5: Special Topics

429

Chart 75

  430

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 76

We  have  narrowed  to  the  range  13Cp20-15Cp00,  based  on  lagna  in  D-4  and  D-9.
Now  let  us  consider  D-10,  the  chart  of  career.  The  native  is  a  dynamic  software
engineer.  In  D-10,  AL  shows  one’s  status  in  career  and  how  people  perceive  one.
Here AL is in Virgo and its lord Mercury aspects it. So he is perceived in his career

Part 5: Special Topics

431

as an intelligent person (Virgo and Mercury). The 10th house from AL has Mercury
and Mars and it can explain a career in software.

So  probably  lagna  in  D-10  is  correct.  This  confirms  that  lagna  is  between  12Cp00
and 15Cp00. But we have no further narrowing down because of D-10. We still have
13Cp20-15Cp00 as the rectified window.

Now let us go to a higher level divisional chart and take D-24, the chart of education
and learning. The native studied computer science at a  good engineering  college in
India during his Jupiter dasa. With lagna in Ta, the 4th house of education is in Le.
Sun owns it. Rahu, Ketu, Venus and Mars aspect it. With this, education in medicine
or  management  is  likely.  Education  in  computer  science  is  unlikely.  Moreover,
education in Jupiter dasa is unlikely.

If we take the birthtime above 13Cp45, lagna in D-24 changes from Ta to Ge. Then
the 4th house is in Vi, aspected by Mercury, Moon and Jupiter. Mercury  and Virgo
can give education in computer science. Jupiter is in own house. He aspects the 4th
house  and  joins  4th  lord  Mercury.  So  his  dasa  can  give  education.  A4  is  in  Ge  and
Sun occupies it. So he may study at a popular college of engineering or science.

To get lagna in D-24 in Ge instead of Ta, lagna needs to be above 13Cp45. So the
final rectified birthtime window after looking at the four divisional charts is 13Cp45-
15Cp00. To narrow down further, we need to look at D-40, D-45 and D-60. We can
also use Kalachakra dasa.

With a birthtime of 10:36 am, we have lagna at 13Cp16 and Kalachakra dasa of Ta
runs from 1987 to 2003. The native got married at the end of 1996. Ta dasa makes
sense because navamsa lagna is in Ta. We should look at antardasa now. Pi antardasa
starts in May 1995, Ar antardasa in April 1997 and Ta antardasa in Aug 1998.

Because the rectified birthtime has to be between 13Cp45 and 15Cp00, let us first try
13Cp45.  We  need  to  add  half  a  degree  to  lagna.  So  we  need  to  add  2  minutes  to
birthtime and make it 10:38 am. The paramayush is 86 years and if we add 2 minutes
to the birthtime, we should subtract 82x2 = 164 days from dasa dates. This brings the
start  date  of  Ar  antardasa  to  Oct  1996  and  Ta  antardasa  to  Feb  1998.  However,
marriage is unlikely in Pi and Ar antardasas. With Ta being lagna and Ge being the
7th house from Venus, marriage is most likely in Ta and Ge antardasas. So the start
date of Ta antardasa must be moved from Feb 1998 to the end of 1996. We need to

  432

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

subtract  about  400  days  from  the  dasa  dates.  This  requires  further  addition  of
400/86=4.7 minutes to the birthtime. This will add another degree to lagna and lagna
will  be  just  below  15º.  The  rectified  birthtime  is  around  10:42:30.  The  error  in  the
reported birthtime can be due to errors in the clock used.

Of course, if we use the rectified birthdata and verify a few more events in the life of
the native, we can be more confident that the rectification is correct.

Example 131: Suppose an astrologer friend of ours approaches us with the rasi chart
of a gentleman, shown in Chart 77. Because the birth happened in 1939, we cannot
rule out huge errors. The error need not be just 2 or 3 minutes. An error of even 10
minutes is possible.

Chart 77

Let us say that the only thing our friend knows about this gentleman is that he thinks
that  1978-79  was  the  golden  period  of  life  in  terms  of  his  finances  and  that  he  has
been experiencing financial tightness since 1996-97. We have to rectify the chart just
based on this information.

Part 5: Special Topics

433

Which dasa should we use for financial matters? It is Sudasa. Let us find Sudasa.

is

(13º13'25'')/

in  nakshatra

in  Le.  His  advancement

Moon  is  at  13º13'25''  in  Leo.  He  is  in  Makha  constellation,  which  runs  from  0º  to
(13º20')  =
13º20'
(793.4167')/(800') = 0.99177. The same fraction of the entire zodiac is 0.99177x360
=  357.0375º  =  357º  2'  15''.  Adding  this  to  lagna,  we  get  Sree  Lagna.  Lagna  is  at
17º35'50''  in  Pi.  So  we  get  Sree  Lagna  at  14º38'5''  in  Pi.  Sudasa  starts  from  Pi.
Because Sree Lagna is in an even rasi, Sudasa goes backward. We reckon quadrants,
panapharas and apoklimas backwards and get Pi, Sg, Vi, Ge, Aq, Sc, Le, Ta, Cp, Li,
Cn and Ar. Dasa periods are as in Narayana dasa. However, there is an exception for
the  first  dasa.  Because  Jupiter  is  in  Pi,  Pi  dasa  is  for  12  years.  However,  only  a
fraction of this is left at birth, based on the fraction of the rasi yet to be traversed by
Sree Lagna. This fraction is (30º – 14º38'5'')/ 30º = 0.51218. So the remainder of Pi
dasa at birth is 0.51218x12 years = 6 years 1 month 23 days.

We get dasas as

Pi (6.15 yrs):  Sep 12, 1939 – Oct 03, 1945
Sg (03 years):  Oct 03, 1945 – Oct 03, 1948
Vi (01 years):  Oct 03, 1948 – Oct 03, 1949
Ge (02 years):  Oct 03, 1949 – Oct 03, 1951
Aq (09 years):  Oct 03, 1951 – Oct 03, 1960
Sc (05 years):  Oct 03, 1960 – Oct 03, 1965
Le (12 years):  Oct 03, 1965 – Oct 03, 1977
Ta (03 years):  Oct 03, 1977 – Oct 03, 1980
Cp (08 years):  Oct 03, 1980 – Oct 03, 1988
Li (10 years):  Oct 03, 1988 – Oct 03, 1998
Cn (11 years):  Oct 03, 1998 – Oct 03, 2009

Why  did  the  native  start  feeling  financial  tightness  in  1996-97?  Libra  dasa  was
running then. Though Libra has Rahu in it, it is nevertheless the 11th house from AL.
Sudasa of the 11th house from AL is usually favorable.

However, we see that Cn dasa started in 1998. Cn is the 8th house from AL. The 8th
house from AL stands for fall of status and material setbacks. It can certainly show
financial  tightness  in  Sudasa.  Though  two  good  upagrahas  (Artha  Prahara  and
Yamaghantaka  –  similar  to  Mercury  and  Jupiter  in  effects)  are  present  in  it,  Cn
contains two highly malefic upagrahas also – Indrachapa and Upaketu.

  434

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

If the native has been experiencing financial tightness since Cn dasa started, it makes
good sense. So probably Cn dasa should start in mid-1996 instead of Oct 1998. What
is the required change in birth time for this change in Sudasa dates?

Exercise 51: We calculated the formulas for the  approximate change in  Vimsottari
dasa  and  Kalachakra  dasa  dates  if  birthtime  changes  by  m  minutes.  Do  the  same
thing for Sudasa.

Complete the exercise before reading further. Based on the formula at the end of the
exercise, dates of dasas in Sudasa move back by 6x12xm days if we add m minutes to
the  birthtime.  We  want  it  to  move  by  2  years  or  720  days.  So  m  should  be
720/(6x12), i.e. 10. We should add 10 minutes to the birthtime and make it 7:40 pm.
However,  after  calculating  Sudasa  for  a  birthtime  of  7:40  pm,  we  realize  that  the
dates of dasas have moved by almost 2.5 years instead of 2 years91. To get dasa start
dates 2 years earlier, we just need to make the birthtime 7:38 pm.

With this new time, Cn dasa started in mid-1996. With Cn being the 8th house from
AL, its dasa gave financial tightness.

Example  132:  Suppose  the  rasi  chart  in  Chart  78  is  given  to  us  as  the  chart  of
Microsoft company’s Bill Gates. Suppose we have verified several divisional charts
and they seem fine. Suppose we want to micro-rectify it.

The  technique  to  be  used  for  birthtime  rectification  varies  from  chart  to  chart.  If
one’s D-10 lagna is close to a rasi border, we should use a technique that is sensitive
to D-10 lagna and see which alternative makes better sense. If GL is close to a rasi
border,  we  should  use  a  technique  that  depends  critically  on  GL  and  see  which
alternative makes better sense.

Here  one  can  note  that  Sree  Lagna  (SL)  is  on  a  rasi  border.  With  the  birthtime  of
9:15 pm, SL is at 28Ar15. If a few minutes are added to the birthtime, SL will be in
Ta.  We  should  use  a  technique  that  is  sensitive  to  the  rasi  occupied  by  SL  and  see
whether SL in Ar or Ta makes better sense.

91 The error in our approximations is due to assuming that lagna and Moon move at a certain uniform
rate. The rate at which they move is not really linear/uniform. So the formulas given here should only
be used for reference. One should finally compute charts and dasas for the rectified time and verify
the rectification.

Part 5: Special Topics

435

Of course, Sudasa depends on SL and we should compute Sudasa.

Chart 78

If SL is in Ar, Sudasa starts from Ar and goes as Ar, Cn, Li, Cp, Ta, Le, Sc etc. If SL
is in Ta, Sudasa starts from Ta. Normally it will go as Ta, Aq, Sc, Le, Ar, Cp, Li etc,
but Ketu’s presence in Ta reverses the direction. So Sudasa goes as Ta, Le, Sc, Aq,
Ge, Vi, Sg etc.

In the first case, one can see that Scorpio dasa runs from 1990 to 2000. In the second
case, Virgo dasa runs during 1988-2000.  Bill Gates was financially very successful
and  he  became  the  world’s  richest  man  in  late  1990’s.  Which  dasa  explains  his
financial success better?

Scorpio  is  the  3rd  house  from  AL  and  upachayas  from  AL  bring  improvements  in
one’s  status.  However,  Scorpio  has  no  aspect  on  HL.  Moreover,  it  is  afflicted  by
Rahu. So Scorpio dasa is not that great.

  436

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

On  the  other  hand,  Virgo  dasa  can  bring  excellent  results.  It  contains  AL  and  its
exalted lord. It is aspected by bhaagya pada (A9, arudha pada of the 9th house) and
occupied by the exalted lord of bhagya pada. The 9th house shows one’s fortune. One
may  be  fortunate  to  have  a  good  guru  and  one  may  be  fortunate  to  have  a  good
leader. But the world’s perceptions of one’s fortune are driven by the recognition one
gets and formal distinctions like being named in Forbes list of richest men. These are
what drive the world’s perceptions about one’s fortune. A9 shows them the best. If
Sudasa  of  a  rasi  containing  the  exalted  lord  of  A9  and  aspected  by  A9  runs,  it  can
very  much  bring  material  fortune  of  the  highest  kind.  Moreover,  Vi  aspects  HL  in
Sg.  For  all  these  reasons,  SL  in  Ta  explains  the  native’s  known  past  better.  So  we
should add a few minutes to the birthtime.

Chart 79

Example  133:  Let  us  consider  a  lady  whose  D-10  is  shown  in  Chart  79.  She  is  a
good singer and sang in some radio and television programs in India, but her career
was cut down when she got married to an Indian engineer in USA and went to USA
with him. In 1998, she started a music school in USA and started teaching Carnatic
(south Indian classical) music.

Part 5: Special Topics

437

In her D-10, Mars in the 10th house shows own ventures and enterprise. The 10th lord
Sun  joins  Venus  in  the  5th  house  and  shows  fame  as  a  singer.  Sun-Venus
combination  can  show  music.  Venus  stands  for  creative  activities.  Sun  and  Moon
stand for music. Sun stands for rhythm and Moon stands for melody. So a career in
music  is  possible.  As  per  Vimsottari  dasa,  Sun  dasa  started  in  1998.  This  may  be
why her career was restarted in 1998. Let us check her Kalachakra dasa.

Kalachakra dasa of Aquarius started in October 1999. It may be noted that Aquarius
contains Venus and 10th lord Sun. So Kalachakra dasa must have started just before
she started her music institute. To get the Kalachakra dasas a little earlier, we need to
add  a  little  to  the  birthtime.  So  we  should  add  a  few  minutes  to  the  birthtime  and
make sure that Kalachakra dasa of Aquarius starts just before her career is restarted.

We have so far looked at 4 examples. In the first example, we had to look at several
divisional  charts  to  rectify  the  birthtime.  In  the  second  example,  we  rectified  the
birthtime based on a dasa. We did it because the past events given to us relate to an
area of life (finances), for which there is an appropriate dasa. In the 3rd chart also, we
used the same dasa, but for a different reason. We did it because a key parameter was
on a rasi border. In the 4th example, we used Kalachakra dasa. Being a sensitive dasa,
Kalachakra dasa is usually very useful in carrying out a fine birthtime rectification.

One should choose the approach on a chart-by-chart basis. The information provided
by  a  client  about  past  events  should  decide  the  techniques  to  be  used.  Birthtime
rectification  is  an  area  in  which  one  can  become  good  only  after  considerable
practice. There are no hard and fast rules.

32.5  Conclusion

There  are  two  kinds  of  birthtime  rectification  –  macro-rectification  and  micro-
rectification.  Macro-rectification  is  the  case  when  you  have  two  or  more  totally
different birthdata from different sources and want to find out which is correct. For
example, there are different versions of Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s birthdata. If we want to
find out which is correct, we have to look at various divisional charts and life events
and see which one works better.

  438

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Micro-rectification  is  the  one  that  we  will  need  the  most  in  practical  consultations.
The birthdata reported by clients usually has a little error and we have to rectify the
birthtime.

Some  people  use  some  formula  based  techniques  for  birthtime  rectification  and
assume  that  human  births  happen  only  in  certain  quanta  of  time.  Most  of  those
techniques do not work. The only correct way to rectify a birthtime is to correct it in
such  a  way  that  one’s  nature  and  past  life  events  are  well  explained.  An  astrologer
should have an idea of the change introduced in various computations if the birthtime
changes a little. Using lagna in D-9, D-10 etc, we can broadly rectify the birthtime.
Then we can rectify it with a finer precision by going to higher divisional charts like
D-20 and D-24 and using Kalachakra dasa. A couple of examples were provided in
this  book.  Readers  should  understand  the  examples  thoroughly  and  practice  these
techniques  with  as  many  charts  as  they  can.  The  adage  that  practice  makes  one
perfect  is  particularly  true  in  this  area.  Readers  should  remember  that  correct
birthtime rectification lays a solid foundation for the entire chart analysis – without
correct  birthtime  rectification,  all  other  fine  techniques  we  learnt  in  this  book  are
useless.

32.6  Answers to Exercises

Exercise 50:

GL in D-10 goes to the next rasi at multiples of 3º. Here it goes from Aq to Pi when
GL crosses 21º.  It goes from Pi to Ar when GL  crosses 24º. So GL has to be at or
above 24Le00. So the amount we have to add is 24º0' – 20º 37' = 3º 21' = 201'.

GL  moves  by  201'  in  201  x  0.48  sec  =  96.48  sec  =  1  min  6.48  sec.  So  we  should
roughly add 1 min 7 sec and the birthtime should be 9:06:07 am or above.

There is an upper limit also. If it becomes too high, GL in D-10 will move from Ar
to Ta. But we decided that GL in D-10 in Ar makes the best sense. So we cannot add
another 3º to GL. GL moves by 3º in 3 x 4/5 = 12/5 min = 2 min 24 sec. Adding this
to  9:06:07,  we  get  9:08:31.  So  the  birthtime  should  be  between  9:06:07  am  and
9:08:31 am for GL in D-10 to be in Ar.

If  we  create  several  inequations  like  the  above  using  lagna  and  special  lagnas  in
various divisional charts, we can narrow down to the correct birthtime.

Exercise 51:

Lagna  moves  by  30º  if  the  birthtime  changes  by  120  minutes.  If  the  birthtime
changes by m minutes, lagna changes by (m/120)x30 = (m/4)º. Moon moves by 3º20'
(one quarter of a nakshatra) in 6 hours or 360 minutes. So, if the birthtime changes
by m minutes, Moon’s longitude changes by (m/360)x(3º20'). So the fraction of the
nakshatra  occupied  by  Moon  that  is  already  traversed  by  Moon,  changes  by
(m/360)x(3º20')/(13º20')=m/(360x4).  When  we  find  this  as  a  fraction  of  the  zodiac,
the  change  is  360ºxm/(360x4)  =  (m/4)º.  The  error  in  Sree  Lagna  is  the  sum  of  the
error  in  lagna  and  the  error  in  this  fraction  of  zodiac.  So  Sree  Lagna  changes  by
(m/4)º + (m/4)º = (m/2)º.

Lesson: Sree Lagna moves twice as fast as lagna. Hora lagna and Sree lagna, which
move  twice  as  fast  as  lagna,  show  the  matters  related  to  the  2nd  house,  i.e.  money
(HL  is  useful  in  death  also).  Ghati  lagna,  which  moves  5  times  as  fast  as  lagna,
shows the matters related to the 5th house, i.e. fame, power and authority.

If Sree Lagna increases by (m/2)º, then (30º – Sree Lagna) decreases by (m/2)º. The
fraction  (30º  –  Sree  Lagna)/30º  decreases  by  (m/60).  If  the  complete  length  of  the
first  dasa  is  n  years,  then  the  remainder  of  the  first  dasa  at  birth  decreases  by
nx(m/60) years = (6 x n x m) days. If the remainder of the first dasa at birth decreases
by these many days, all dasas come these many days earlier.

Formula: If the complete Narayana dasa length of the first dasa in Sudasa is n years
and the birthtime changes by m minutes, all the dasa and antardasa dates change by
approximately (6  x n  x m) days. If the birthtime is earlier, dasas will come later and
vice versa.

CAUTION: When we consider a change in birthtime by m minutes, it is possible that
Moon  changes  nakshatra  during  the  time.  The  above  calculations  still  hold.  When
Moon is at the end of a nakshatra, the amount added to lagna to get Sree lagna is just
below 360º. When Moon moves to the next nakshatra, it changes to 0º. Though we
have a big change in numbers, it is a continuous change and 360º = 0º. So we need
not worry and we can use the above formula. However, if Sree  Lagna changes rasi
during the m minutes, Sudasa calculation changes completely and the above formula

  440

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

is no longer valid. For example, if Sree Lagna is at 29º in Ar and we consider adding
4 min to the birthtime, it changes Sree Lagna by (4/2)º and it goes to 1º in Ta. The
whole dasa sequence changes now and we cannot use the above formula.

33.  Rational Thinking

33.1  Introduction

Astrology lovers insist that it is a science. But any conscientious person familiar with
the  modern  definition  of  “science”  will  agree  that  it  is  not  a  science.  It  may  have
been  a  science  a  few  thousand  years  back,  but  it  is  no  longer  a  science.  A  lot  of
astrological knowledge of Vedic times became corrupt in the last few hundred years,
because of the degeneration of Indian culture precipitated by foreign invasions. The
correct knowledge of the science of Vedic astrology is broken into parts and hidden
in small corners of India. There are a lot of traditional families in India, which guard
some  special  astrological  techniques  as  “family  secrets”.  The  knowledge  that  is
explicitly taught in most books – including this book – is either incomplete or simply
incorrect.  Gathering  the  correct  knowledge  from  the  remote  corners  of  India  and
consolidating it is a daunting task.

It makes no sense to start from scratch and develop this subject completely. The best
approach  is  to  understand  the  teachings  of  Sages  correctly  and  then  experiment  to
confirm  our  understanding.  However,  it  is  easier  said  than  done.  Astrologers  don’t
agree even on the basics – such as the zodiac to be used and the ayanamsa. There are
just too many things that are ambiguous and not completely clarified in classics. To
complicate things further, some modern savants are making their own ill-considered
departures  from  the  teachings  of  Sages  and  foolishly  popularizing  them.  That  only
adds to the corruption of this knowledge.

The bottom line is — things are in a mess and astrology is far from being a science.
However,  readers  need  not  despair.  It  is  this  author’s  prediction  that  astrology
research will flourish in the coming century and a lot of long-standing issues will be
resolved conclusively.

Understanding and accepting that a problem exists is the first step in fixing it. This
author’s intention is to make the readers aware of the problems. While we certainly
want  to  keep  the  sanctity  of  the  subject  of  astrology  intact  and  not  unduly  worry
about having it accepted as a science, it can only do good to apply the paradigms of
modern science and approach astrology with a rational outlook.

  442

33.2  Irrational Explanations

Because of the corruption that is rampant in astrological knowledge, people often use
wrong  principles  to  explain  an  event  and  fail  in  presenting  straight-forward  and
sound logic. They beat around the bush to explain an event sometimes.

Example 134: We may hear people making a typing mistake and saying,“Mercury is
retrograde.  That  is  why  people  are  making  mistakes  these  days”.  Pray,  do  these
mistakes  happen  only  when  Mercury  is  retrograde?  Or,  do  they  happen  with  a
considerably higher frequency when Mercury is retrograde? Mercury’s retrogression
may  last  a  couple  of  weeks  and  do  the  mistakes  happen  exactly  during  those  two
weeks?

If  not,  how  can  we  correlate  Mercury’s  retrogression  and  the  typing  mistakes?
Probably the mistakes happen all the time, but they are more frequent during a few
days. But the reason has to be a sookshma dasa or a praana dasa or a Bhrigu transit
during that time, rather than Mercury’s retrogression.

We should look at the nature of the event and the time period of its effectiveness and
look for an astrological factor with about the same period of effectiveness. One may
make typing mistakes everyday, but a particular day may be worse than usual. In that
case, the period of effectiveness of the event (viz making too many typing mistakes)
is that day. A month-long retrogression or a year-long transit cannot be its reason. If
we correlate it with an astrological factor with the same period of effectiveness (e.g.
a sookshma dasa of Narayana dasa or Mercury’s D-27 transit in a sign occupied in
natal  rasi  chart  by  Rahu),  it  is  plausible.  But  if  we  attribute  the  event  to  retrograde
Mercury or debilitated Jupiter, it is not logical.

Example  135:  Someone  may  have  a  very  bad  time  at  his  office  on  a  particular
afternoon. He may say,“oh, it’s because I am running the Vimsottari dasa of the 8th
lord in D-10.”

It is true that the 8th lord in D-10 can  give the results experienced, but that doesn’t
mean  his  dasa  was  responsible  for  an  isolated  event  in  an  afternoon.  If  one  has

Part 5: Special Topics

443

similar experiences frequently, during the entire period of a dasa, then we can blame
that dasa. After all, a dasa shows the overall mood in a long period of time.

However, if that is not the case and the experience is an isolated incident, then it is
irrational  to  explain  it  using  a  dasa.  Some  other  astrological  factor  with  a  smaller
period of effect may have caused the event. For example, Moon may be transiting in
D-10 in a rasi occupied by Saturn and Rahu in natal rasi chart. Moon, Sun and lagna
lord in D-10 may be transiting in kakshyas without a rekha. The latter may show a
bad  period  of  a  few  days  and  the  former  factor  with  a  period  of  effectiveness  of
about 6 hours may have triggered the event.

We  will  find  the  correct  factor  behind  an  event  only  if  we  search  for  it  without
compromising. A true researcher never compromises. Of course, there may be many
astrological factors contributing to the manufacturing of an event and we may not be
able  to  find  all  of  them  because  we  don’t  know  all  the  possible  techniques.
Nevertheless,  we  should  try  to  find  the  right  factor  within  the  limits  of  our
knowledge.  Accepting  a  wrong  factor  as  the  reason  for  an  event  is  illogical.
Attributing an isolated incident  in a day to a dasa that runs for 10 years is irrational.

Some astrologers may make a correct prediction based on illogical thinking, due to
luck (or spiritual strength). We should not be blinded by the success of a prediction.
Success of a prediction does not prove the validity of the methods used. We may try
to  enhance  our  predictive  success  through  good  spiritual  practices,  but  we  should
also  try  to  identify  the  right  factors  behind  various  events  and  consolidate  the
scientific aspects of Vedic astrology. The scientific and spiritual aspects of astrology
should go together and strengthen each other.

33.3  Known Past vs Future

Some authors present some principles in their books and present many examples that
show the efficacy of the principles.

However,  one  finds  many  times  that  these  principles  are  too  vague  to  be  useful  in
practice.  They  are  good  enough  to  explain  known  past,  but  not  good  enough  to
predict future.

  444

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

An  extreme  example  will  make  this  clearer.  Suppose  someone  presents  us  with  a
principle:  “Someone  born  with  lagna  in  an  airy  sign  gets  married  when  Venus
transits  in  an  own  sign  or  a  friendly  sign  or  a  watery  sign  or  a  trine  from  natal  7th
house”. It may make sense to us, because Venus is the significator of marriage and
being  in  an  own  sign  or  a  friendly  sign  or  a  watery  sign  makes  this  watery  planet
strong. Also, Venus transiting in a trine from natal 7th house may seem favorable for
marriage to occur.

We may test this principle against as many examples as we want and we will find it
to be satisfied in 100% cases. Does that mean that this is an excellent principle?

No! This is not a meaningful or useful principle at all. Why? The list  given covers
the entire zodiac. Ta and Li are own signs of Venus. Ge, Vi, Cp and Aq are friendly
signs. Cn, Sc and Pi are watery signs. Ar, Le and Sg are trines from the 7th house for
any person with lagna in an airy sign. If you count the signs, you will find that all the
twelve  signs  are  covered!  So  the  principle  indirectly  means,  “someone  born  in  an
airy sign gets married when Venus transits in one of the 12 signs”. Of course, Venus
transits one of the 12 signs always and this is a trivially correct statement. So it will
be satisfied in the case of all people with lagna in an airy sign.

But,  can  we  use  it  to  make  any  predictions?  If  we  get  the  chart  of  someone  with
lagna in an airy sign, can we predict using this principle when he will get married?
No!

This  is  the  problem  with  vague  astrological  principles.  True,  this  is  an  extreme
example, but didn’t “Venus in own or friendly or watery sign or a trine from the 7th
house” make some sense to us? However, it turned out to be too general (or vague)
to help us in making a precise prediction.

Constructors  like  the  above  are  commonly  found  in  astrological  literature.  We  talk
about the 7th lord giving marriage or a planet aspecting or occupying 7th or 7th lord.
Or a planet having an argala on 7th or 7th lord. If it is still not enough, we can add the
nakshatra lord of 7th lord or his dispositor or someone else. As we add conditions, we
finally  cover  all  the  planets.  We  can  always  explain  the  known  past  this  way.  Of
course, if we have a standard procedure for finding the strongest candidate among all
those planets and if his dasa always gives the results, then it is logical. But, if there
are  6  candidates  and  we  explain  an  event  by  simply  showing  the  candidacy  of  the

Part 5: Special Topics

445

planet  involved,  it  is  irrational.  We  are  in  trouble  when  making  predictions  about
future in that approach – which of the umpteen candidates will give the result?

The root cause of the problem is that we often use the wrong tool to analyze a matter.
Sages explained hundreds of dasa systems and yet we use only a handful. When we
use the correct technique, probably the strongest candidate gives the result. When we
use a wrong technique, we are forced to give a vague justification.

For example, we saw in Example 58 that Mercury (8th lord in 7th) and Rahu (malefic
in 2nd) were the strongest killer planets. By taking a variation of Vimsottari dasa that
starts  from  the  8th  star  from  Moon’s  star,  we  found  that  the  native  passed  away  in
Rahu’s  antardasa  in  Mercury’s  dasa.  However,  one  relying  on  standard  Vimsottari
dasa always will find that Venus dasa is running and he will explain the event based
on the situation of Venus in the 7th house. But, if we take yogakaraka Venus to be a
maraka because he is in the 7th house, we can take 6 planets (occupants and lords of
2nd and 7th) as marakas. With 6 planets out of 9 qualifying as marakas, how can we
predict  when  the  native  passes  away?  On  the  other  hand,  by  using  the  most
appropriate dasa, we see that the event was given by the strongest candidates.

Because of the corruption in astrological knowledge, many contemporary astrologers
don’t use the most appropriate techniques always. Due to this, they have to deal with
a  lot  of  vagueness  and  they  rely  on  spiritual  strength  for  correct  predictions.  When
explaining  the  past,  a  vague  principle  is  fine.  But  predicting  the  future  becomes
difficult. One needs luck or spiritual strength.

33.4  Probability Analysis92

The  point  made  above  can  be  expressed  mathematically.  Let  us  say  that  event  A
denotes  the  occurrence  (satisfying)  of  an  astrological  combination.  Let  us  say  that
event B denotes the occurrence of an event. Let us say that we want to correlate and
link A with  B.  For  example, event  A can be  “Venus transits in a trine  from the 7th
house” and event B can be “the native gets married”.

92 Some knowledge of the probability theory will be assumed in this discussion. Readers can refer to
standard high school/college mathematics textbooks.

  446

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Now  the  conditional  probability  P(A|B)  denotes  the  probability  (or  chance)  that  A
occurs, given that B occurred, i.e. the chance that the combination is satisfied given
that one gets married.

And P(B|A) denotes the probability (or chance) that B occurs, given that A occurred,
i.e. the chance that one gets married given the combination is satisfied.

The two are different. When making predictions in real life, we are concerned with
P(B|A). However, when explaining a known event in a book, we are concerned with
P(A|B).  If  A  is  a  large  composite  of  many  small  conditions  joined  by  “or”  (e.g.
Venus trnasits in a trine from the 7th house or Jupiter aspects UL in transit or dasa of
UL  lord  runs  or  dasa  of  7th  lord  runs),  we  maximize  P(A|B).  In  other  words,  A  is
satisfied in most charts when B (marriage) occurs. So we think that A is an excellent
principle with a good correlation with event B. However, making A very large makes
P(B|A) very low and we can’t predict B just because A occurred.

So we should stop unduly worrying about P(A|B) and we should worry more about
P(B|A). High P(A|B) helps us in giving nice examples in books. It doesn’t help us in
predictions.  We  should  not  make  our  principles  vague  combinations  of  many
components (e.g. if combinations x or y or z or w or v or u is satisfied, then event B
occurs).  We  should  always  identify  the  strongest  candidate  to  give  an  event.  If  an
event is given by one of the six or seven weak candidates, we should reject the logic
and  search  for  an  alternative  technique  in  which  the  event  is  given  by  the  best
candidate.  Only  with  an  uncompromising  rational  approach  and  dedicated  research
into the teachings of great Sages can we ever appreciate the subject of astrology in its
fullest glory.

33.5  Statistical Research

When  we  come  across  an  astrological  principle,  we  can  evaluate  its  worth  using
statistical research. We  can take  as many  examples as we can and  find out in what
percentage of  examples the principle is satisfied. Sometimes the result attributed to
an astrological  combination may be vague and subjective. But sometimes, we have
clearly defined events as results and we can use statistical research in such cases.

Example  136:  Suppose  we  want  to  evaluate  the  principle:  “one  gets  married  when
the dasa and the antardasa as per Navamsa Narayana dasa belong to one of the four –

Part 5: Special Topics

447

lagna,  upapada,  3rd  from  upapada  and  8th  from  upapada”.  It  is  clearly  defined.  We
can take 200 charts of married people and find the dasa and the antardasa running at
the  time  of  marriage.  We  can  find  the  number  of  charts  in  which  both  dasa  and
antardasa belong to the 4 signs mentioned. Suppose the number of such charts is 90.
So the success rate of the principle is 90x100/200 = 45%.

This  means  that  the  predictions  made  just  using  this  principle  will  not  have  100%
success. However, the question is — is 45% good enough for this principle or not?

Assuming  that  there  is  really  no  correlation  between  getting  married  and  this
combination,  we  can  find  the  expected  success  rate.  If  the  real  success  rate  is
considerably higher, it means that there is a correlation. It will become clearer after
we make some calculations.

Suppose there is no correlation between the above combination and getting married.
Then let us find the probability of the dasa and the antardasa being one  of the four
signs on a random date. We have 4 signs. To maximize this probability (i.e. go to the
worst case), let us say that lagna is not in the same sign as UL or the 3rd/8th from UL.
So  we  have  4  signs  out  of  12.  The  probability  that  the  dasa  on  any  day  belongs  to
these  4  signs  is  4/12=1/3.  Similarly,  the  probability  that  the  antardasa  on  any  day
belongs  to  these  4  signs  is  4/12=1/3.  These  two  events  are  independent  and  the
probability  that  the  dasa  and  the  antardasa  on  any  day  belong  to  these  4  signs  is
(1/3)x(1/3) = 1/9. Expressed as a percentage, this is 11%.

What this means is — if we find the dasa and the antardasa on any day, both belong
to lagna or the 1st, 3rd or 8th from UL in only 11% cases on average. However, if the
dasa and the antardasa on the day of marriage belong to these 4 signs in 45% cases, it
is 4 times the exepected success rate. That clearly shows that there is a link between
the combination and marriage. This shows a statistically significant correlation.

Analysis as above does not directly help us in making predictions, but it helps us in
validating atleast a part of astrology as a probabilistic science. Astrology researchers
who  have  the  resources  and  skills  should  intelligently  formulate  well-defined
principles,  test  them  statistically  and  find  the  success  rate  and  compare  it  with  the
expected success rate as above. Instead of lamenting the rejection of astrology by the
scientific community, we should engage in this exercise and convince ourselves first.

  448

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

This author is confident that exercises like this will establish parts of Vedic astrology
as a science in the coming decades. Such statistical studies were conducted by some
scientists and western astrologers in the past, but those people did not use the right
factors. They did not have a proper grounding in serious Vedic astrology. Divisions,
houses,  arudhas,  argalas,  multiple  dasas  etc  will  enable  us  to  conduct  more
meaningful and fruitive statistical research. Fuzzy logic theory will also be helpful.

Exercise  52:  Suppose  we  evaluate  the  principle:  “Chara  dasa  of  a  rasi  occupied  or
aspected  by  the  3rd  house  or  a  rasi  occupied  or  aspected  by  the  3rd  lord  or  a  rasi
occupied or aspected by BK results in the birth of a brother”. Suppose it is correct in
75% charts we examine. Evaluate the worth of this principle.

[HINT: If events A, B and C are independent, P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) –
P(A).P(B) – P(B).P(C) – P(C).P(A) + P(A).P(B).P(C)]

33.6  Why Astrology Works

While we discuss rational thinking, we may as well address this most asked question:
“Why does astrology work? How can planets have an impact on us? Isn’t it irrational
to think they do?”

Unfortunately we don’t know exactly why planets influence us. We may not find that
out in near future. Nevertheless, the subject of astrology becomes valid and justified
if  we  prove  some  correlations  statistically.  Even  if  we  cannot  explain  why  planets
influence us, we can still study the correlations between planetary motion and events
in  our  lives.  While  it  will  be  nice  to  be  able  to  answer  the  fundamental  question
raised above, it is not necessary for astrology to be accepted as a statistical science.
Some pseudorational people argue that astrology cannot be a science as long as we
cannot explain why planets influence us. But that is not logical.

Sometimes we cannot explain new observations on the basis of old models and we
have to come up with new theories and postulates. We may not be able to explain the
influence  of  planets  on  us  on  the  basis  of  the  scientific  model  of  the  universe  we
have  today.  But  that  does  not  trivialize  the  statistical  study  of  the  correlations
between planetary combinations and events in the lives of individuals.

33.7  Conclusion

Many astrologers lament the fact astrology is not accepted as a science. But they do
not  realize  that  a  lot  needs  to  be  done  before  astrology  is  accepted  as  a  science.  A
few  common  problems  are  discussed  in  this  chapter.  It  is  this  author’s  hope  that
atleast  some  readers  are  motivated  to  evaluate  astrology  using  the  tools  given  by
modern science. Spirituality, respect for Sages and scientific temper can co-exist.

33.8  Answers to Eexrcises

Exercise 52:

Let  event  A  be:  “dasa  rasi  is  occupied  or  aspected  by  3rd  house”.  Let  event  B  be:
“dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3rd lord”. Let event C be: “dasa rasi is occupied
or aspected by BK”. A rasi is aspected by 3 rasis (by rasi aspect). So P(A), P(B) and
P(C) are all equal to 4/12=1/3 here.

So  the  combined  probability  is  (1/3)+(1/3)+(1/3)–(1/9)–(1/9)–(1/9)+(1/27)  =  19/27
or 70%. Though 75% is higher than 70%, it is not considerably higher. So there isn’t
any statistically significant correlation.

[Basically,  combinations  that  are  satisfied  in  70%  cases  on  average  are  poor
candidates  for our studies. Even if the combination is satisfied in 90% of the cases
when  the  event  occurred,  we  cannot  correlate  the  combination  with  the  event  with
confidence.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  combination  is  satisfied  only  in  5%  cases  on
average,  we  can  suggest  a  good  correlation  even  if  the  combination  is  satisfied  in
25%  cases  when  the  event  occurred.  Because  25  is  5  times  5,  there  is  a  strong
correlation between the combination and the event in that case.]

34.  Remedial Measures

34.1  Introduction

After  stressing  the  importance  of  rational  thinking  in  astrological  analysis,  let  us
come  to  an  important  topic  that  has  no  rational  explanation.  Those  who  have  no
belief in Vedic remedies may skip this chapter.

An expert astrologer may be able to predict bad times and setbacks successfully. But
what good is it for, if something cannot be done to avert the setbacks and bad times?
A doctor not only identifies the disease one is suffering from, but prescribes drugs to
cure it. Can we do the same thing in astrology?

In this chapter, we will take a look at remedial measures. Remedial measures are the
measures  that  are  taken  to  remedy  the  unfortunate  situations  that  a  native  is  going
through or is expected to go through.

The pattern to be followed by one’s life is decided at the time of one’s birth by the of
planetary position then, which is in turn decided by the karma (actions) accumulated
in  past  lives.  However,  it  only  decides  the  basic  ‘pattern’  and  not  all  the  minute
details.  Though  the  basic  pattern  cannot  be  easily  altered,  the  exact  details  can  be
altered by exercising free will. For example, one may be destined to have a vehicular
accident on a particular day, but it can be a minor accident or a major one. Actions
taken by one’s free will have a role, along with the accumulated actions (karma) of
past lives, in deciding the exact details. Remedial measures are the measures we take
in order to manipulate the exact details to be relatively favorable to us.

34.1.1  Common-sense Remedies

When we anticipate good happenings, we can afford to take a few risks. On the other
hand,  we  can  take  extra  precautions  when  we  anticipate  bad  happenings.  If  an
accident is possible in  a  period, we can drive very  carefully or  even  avoid travel if
possible. If quarrels with authorities are possible in a period, one can be extra careful
and consciously try to restrain oneself.

Part 5: Special Topics

451

In  this  manner,  we  can  take  common  sense  precautions  to  avert,  or  to  reduce  the
impact of, the bad events anticipated.

34.1.2  Pacifying Planets

In Hinduism, we can remedy a bad result by the pacification of planets. There are 4
ways to make planets happy:

(1)  Wearing  a  gemstone:  This  works  only  for  planets  that  are  favorable  in  one’s

horoscope. We can wear the gemstones of such planets to protect us.

(2)  Good deeds: By committing good deeds, we can pacify planets.

(3)  Planetary  Propitiation:  By  reciting  the  mantras  and  stotras  of  planets,  we  can
pacify them. Mantra is a combination of sounds with a special power to produce
beneficial spiritual waves within us. Stotras are hymns in praise of planets.

(4)  Propitiation  of  Deities:  By  propitiating  various  deities,  we  can  pacify  various

planets.

34.2  Gemstones

One can wear the gemstones of favorable planets to get the blessings of those planets
and  tide  over  troubles.  Look  at  the  functional  benefics  in  one’s  rasi  chart  and
prescribe their gemstones. If a planet’s dasa is running or if a planet is taking part in
a  favorable  yoga,  we  may  choose  that  planet.  Wearing  the  gemstone  of  a  planet
speeds up the fructification of the good results promised in a chart by that planet.

If  one  wants  good  results  in  a  particular  area  of  life,  we  may  strengthen  favorable
planets  in  the  relevant  divisional  chart.  For  example,  suppose  someone  wants
improvement  in  career.  We  can  prescribe  the  gemstone  of  a  yogakaraka  in  D-10
then. If a functional benefic is badly placed or weak, its gemstone can still be used.
For example, if one has lagna in Cp, Venus is a yogakaraka. Suppose Venus is in the
8th  house  (Le).  Then  he  may  not  give  good  results  in  his  dasa  despite  being  a
yogakaraka.  In  such  a  case,  wearing  diamond  (gemstone  of  Venus)  makes  Venus
powerful  enough  to  give  good  results.  On  the  other  hand,  gemstones  of  functional
malefics in a chart should be avoided as far as possible. In addition, the gemstones of

  452

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

marakas  should  be  avoided  when  one  is  running  maraka  dasas.  A  list  of  the
gemstones and metals of various planets are given in Table 77. A ring made of the
suggested  metal  with  the  suggested  gemstone  can  be  used  for  strengthening  the
planet.

The ring must be worn for the first time on the weekday of the planet. The planetary
strength should be good at that time. The planet ruling the gemstone should be strong
at that time.

We  can  combine  two  gemstones  and  wear  them,  if  the  corresponding  planets  are
friends  and  functional  benefics.  This  is  partciularly  recommended  when  the  two
planets form a yoga. Suppose someone has lagna in Virgo. If 10th lord Mercury and
9th lord Venus are together, they form dharma-karmadhipati yoga. A ring consisting
of emerald and diamond may be advised. Similarly, if Sun and Moon conjoin in the
chart of  a person with Aries lagna, they  form a  raja  yoga  and a ring with ruby  and
pearl may be recommended.

Traditionally, astrologers assign the index finger to Jupiter, middle finger to Saturn,
ring finger to Sun and little finger to Mercury. Traditionally, gemstones of Mercury
and  Venus  are  worn  on  the  little  finger;  gemstone  of  Saturn  is  worn  on  the  middle
finger  and  so  on.  However,  some  astrologers  suggest  that  the  ring  finger,  middle

Part 5: Special Topics

453

finger,  little  finger  and  index  finger  show  the  four  purushaarthas  –  dharma,  artha,
kama  and  moksha  (respectively).  They  suggest  wearing  a  ring  on  the  finger
representing the purushaartha of interest. One desiring marriage may wear the ring of
his 7th lord on the little finger. One desiring good results in career may wear the ring
of a yogakaraka in his D-10 on the middle finger and so on. Index finger represents
moksha and it is usually left ringless.

34.3  Good Deeds

One  can  pacify  planets  by  good  deeds.  Good  deeds  of  this  life  can  compensate  for
the  sins  of  past  lives.  One  can  commit  a  good  deed  in  an  area  ruled  by  a  planet  to
please it. Some examples are listed below:

To please Sun, one may go to a temple or donate money to a temple or help in the
administration  of  a  temple.  To  please  Moon,  one  may  donate  money  to  a  music
institute or help a fair lady. To please Mars, one may engage in physical exercise or
donate  money  to  a  school  gym.  To  please  Mercury,  one  may  donate  money  to  an
organization of scholars or get blessings from a scholar. To please Jupiter, one may
respect and donate money to a learned Brahmin or a priest. Or one may donate cows
to a priest. To please Venus, one may read poetry or help a poet. To please Saturn,
one may perform some physical labor or help some people who live on manual labor.
To please Rahu, one may donate some money to a research organization or go on a
pilgrimage. To please Ketu, one may do meditation.

One can also give away (as charity) the grains ruled by different planets, to propitiate
them. Sun rules wheat, Moon rules rice, Mars rules toor daal (a dark yellow lentil),
Mercury  rules  moong  daal  (smaller  yellow  lentils  of  a  lighter  shade  –  they  have  a
dark green skin), Jupiter rules chick peas, Venus rules a whitish grain, Saturn rules
sesame seeds and Rahu  rules black  gram daal (white lentils with a black skin). For
example,  one  can  please  Jupiter  by  giving  away  a  big  bowl  of  chick  peas  on  a
Thursday morning.

Fasting is also a popular remedial measure. By punishing ourselves by denying the
basic necessity of food, we reduce other punishments. Fasting on the weekday ruled
by  upapada  lord  in  rasi  chart,  for  example,  mitigates  troubles  in  one’s  marriage.
Fasting on the weekday ruled by rajyapada lord may mitigate troubles in career.

  454

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

34.4  Propitiation of Planets

We can propitiate planets by reciting mantras and stotras. Mantra is a combination of
sounds with a special power to produce beneficial spiritual waves within us.

A  mantra  should  be  recited  with  an  accurate  pronunciation  and  intonation.  Some
mantras do not have any intonation, but the pronunciation of sounds must be perfect.
Some  saattwik  mantras  are  self-correcting,  in  the  sense  that  one  reading  it  will
eventually  be  forced  to  learn  the  correct  pronunciation  and  intonation.  Some  other
mantras  can  produce  negative  effects  with  improper  recitation.  So  one  should  be
careful with mantras.

These days, people misuse the term “mantra” and refer to many stotras as mantras.
Stotras are hymns in praise of planets and God. There is no correct intonation to read
a stotra and devotion is important when reciting a stotra. Recitation of a stotra gives
results  very  slowly.  Interested  readers  can  read  the  108  names  of  various  planets
everyday. As lagna is the most important house in a chart and lagna lord shows the
vitality of the chart, one may worship the planet owning lagna in the divisional chart
representing  the  area  of  life  that  one  wants  to  improve.  For  example,  if  one  wants
spiritual progress, lagna lord in D-20 should be worshipped. If one wants pleasures
and comforts, lagna lord in D-16 should be worshipped.

There are different mantras for propitiating planets. In addition, there are kavachas,
stotras and 108 names of all planets.

One popular mantra of each planet is listed below. One should read the stanza given
first  a  few  times  and  then  repeat  the  basic  mantra  thousands  of  times.  The
recommended repitition count is also listed. The weekday ruled by a planet is ideal
for repeating its mantra.

NOTE: The stanzas and mantras are being given only in Devanagari script used by
Sanskrit  and  Hindi  languages.  Those  who  cannot  read  this  script  should  consult  a
competent astrologer or a Hindu priest to learn these stanzas and mantras. This may
cause  an  inconvenience  to  non-Indian  readers  of  this  book,  but  the  purpose  is  to
discourage  mis-pronunciation.  Giving  an  approximate  transliteration  in  the  Roman
script can only encourage mistakes.

There are many other mantras and one can refer to other books for the details. When
reading a stotra, devotion is of utmost importance. When reading a mantra, devotion
as well as the correct pronunciation are important.

34.5  Propitiation of Deities

Instead  of  propitiating  planets  directly,  we  can  propitiate  the  ruling  deities.
Propitiating  the  deity  corresponding  to  lagna  lord  in  a  particular  divisional  chart
brings excellent results in the area of life shown by divisional chart. Propitiation of
the deity corresponding to the strongest planet occupying or owning or aspecting the
12th house from AK in D-9 takes one’s soul closer to liberation.

Lakshmi, Parvati
Vishnu, Brahma
Durga, Narasimha
Ganesa

A  list  of  commonly  suggested  deities  for  each  planet  is  given  in  Table  78.  “Prasna
marga” gives some additional deities. Elders also intuitively prescribe deities based
on the particular planetary combination in a chart. For example, Mercury and Saturn
usually  denote  a  Vaishnava  deity.  Sun  denotes  a  Shaiva  deity.  Moon  and  Venus
denote  a  goddess.  Mars  denotes  a  fiery  form.  Rahu  denotes  an  aggressive  deity.
Based on the planetary combinations in a chart, we can choose the right deity.

For example, let us say we need to please Rahu in a chart. Let us say Mars and Rahu
are  in  Ge,  with  Saturn  and  Mercury  aspecting  them.  Rahu  can  denote  Durga,  but
Saturnine and Mercurian influence suggests a Vaishnava deity. Martian influence on
Rahu shows an angry deity. So “Ugra Narasimha”, an angry form of Vishnu, may be
worshipped to please Rahu. Rahu in Cancer may denote Durga in another chart.  In
another example, Mars may be in a fiery rasi in all vargas and Mercury may join him
and  it  may  show  “Jwala  Narasimha”.  Mars  with  Rahu  (serpent)  may  show
Subrahmanya (Kartikeya) in another chart. Mars with Saturnine influence may show
Hanuman, as Saturn shows a Vaishnava deity and he has humility and the spirit of a
servant.

The guidelines given in books are merely guidelines. The exact application depends
on  an  astrologer’s  knowledge  of  mythology  and  classics  and  familiarity  with  the
natures of various deities. By propitiating a deity who closely represents the spirit of
a planet in a particular chart, one can please the planet more effectively.

34.6  Conclusion

This book is only an introductory textbook of integrated Vedic astrology. While an
effort is made to cover a variety of topics, no topic has been  covered exhaustively.
The coverage of the topics in the current part (“Special Topics”) is particularly brief.
The  purpose  of  this  part  is  just  to  make  the  readers  familiar  with  some  practical
aspects of Vedic astrology. Readers should refer to other books for more details on
these topics. Readers may take advantage of “Vedic Remedies in Astrology” by Pt.

35.  Mundane Astrology

35.1  Introduction

In  this  book,  we  have  so  far  concentrated  on  predicting  the  fortune  of  individual
human beings based on their birthcharts. We sometimes have to predict the collective
fortune of large groups of people. An example is the fortune of a nation. To predict
the  fortune  of  a  nation,  we  can  use  the  birthchart  of  the  leader  of  the  nation,  the
swearing-in  chart  of  the  leader  and  the  birthchart  of  the  nation,  if  available.  When
these are not available, we can use lunar and solar new  year charts and new month
charts.  Solar  charts  are  good  at  showing  some  matters  and  lunar  charts  are  good  at
showing some other matters. There are  also some techniques based on transits. We
can map different nations to different rasis and constellations and take transits with
respect to those rasis and constellations. This approach needs a lot of further research
and it is beyond the scope of this textbook.

Study  of  the  collective  fortune  of  groups  of  people  using  planetary  charts  is  called
“mundane  astrology”  and  birthcharts  of  nations,  swearing-in  charts,  lunar  charts,
solar  charts  and  other  charts  used  in  mundane  astrology  are  known  as  “mundane
charts”.

35.2  Re-interpreted Significations

In mundane charts, we can still use arudha padas, divisional charts etc, but we have
to  re-interpret  the  significations  of  various  charts,  houses  and  arudha  padas
judiciously.  For  example,  D-9  may  show  relations  with  other  nations  and  the  role
played in international polity. D-30 may show internal disturbances and violence. D-
11  may  show  wars  and  terrorist  activities.  D-8  may  show  unexpected  and  sudden
external troubles like natural calamities. D-10 may show political activity. D-24 may
show universities, science, technology, arts, research and activities of intelligentsia.
Arudha lagna may show how a nation is perceived in the world. A3 may shows its
weapons.  A6  may  shows  its  enemies.  A7  may  show  its  allies.  Significations  of
various houses are given below:

Part 5: Special Topics

461

First house: General state of affairs in the nation, public health, cabinet.

Second house: State revenue, wealth, imports, commerce, allies, aristocracy.

Third house: Telecommunications, transportation, journalism, media.

Fourth house: Educational institutions, students, real estate, general feeling of well-
being, trade, agriculture.

Fifth house: Children, new births, crime, parks, mentality of leaders.

Sixth house: State loans, debt, diseases, armed forces, territorial attacks.

Seventh house: Health  of women, immorality, infant mortality, war, relations with
other nations.

Eighth house: Death rate, state treasury, unexpected troubles, instability.

Ninth house: Temples, righteousness, judiciary, fortune.

Tenth  house:  The  ruler,  politics,  parliament,  foreign  trade,  exports,  revolution  and
political instability.

Eleventh house: Gains from other nations, gains in trade, friendship.

Twelfth house: Secret enemies, plots, secret crime, hospitals, wars, losses.

35.3  Using Birthcharts

When  a  new  leader  takes  command  of  a  nation,  it  signals  a  new  beginning  for  the
nation  and  hence  the  chart  cast  for  the  moment  of  swearing-in  is  important.
However,  the  beginning  of  a  new  order  is  more  important  than  the  beginning  of  a
new  command.  When  a  nation  re-organizes  itself  based  on  new  philosophies  and
thought,  it  signals  the  beginning  of  a  new  order.  Chart  cast  for  the  beginning  of  a
new order is more important than a swearing-in chart.

  462

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

For example, the nation of India existed for more than 5,000 years. However, it took
a  new  identity  when  it  won  independence  on  15th  August  1947.  The  independence
chart of India shows the beginning of a new order in India. Though several princely
states joined India after her independence, there was no major change in the identity
of  India.  When  India  formed  its  constitution  and  declared  itself  a  Sovereign
Replublic on 26th January 1950, its identity was only consolidated and not changed.
So  the  independence  chart  (15th  August  1947,  midnight,  Delhi)  is  the  birthchart  of
India and it is the most important one for predicting India’s fortune.

We can use Vimsottari dasa as well as Narayana dasa with a nation’s birthchart. An
example  of  the  interpretation  of  Narayana  dasa  for  a  nation  was  given  in  Example
69. Another technique prominently used with the birthcharts of nations is Tajaka. We
can cast Tajaka  annual charts to predict the fortune of a nation in a  year  and use it
with Sudarsana Chakra dasa93.

Example 137: Let us consider India’s independence chart and Tajaka annual chart of
1997-98 (see Chart 80). India surprised the international community by conducting a
series of nuclear tests in May 1998. Let us look at D-24 (the chart of technology and
research) and find Tajaka annual chart and Sudarsana Chakra dasa.

In natal D-24, lagna in Cp is stronger than Moon and Sun. In 1997, India finished 50
years and started the 51st year. We get 3 by subtracting multiples of 12 from 51. So
Sudarsana Chakra dasa of the 3rd house runs in the year. So dasa belongs to Pi94. We
should cast the annual chart when the 51st year starts and judge the chart w.r.t. Pi.

The most prominent placement is that Sun, Rahu and Ketu are in the 3rd house from
Pi. This makes the 3rd house very  strong and activities related to  aggressive wepon
development make sense. Situation of exalted Mars in the 11th house with two other
planets is also favorable for technical  growth. However, the presence of  debilitated
Venus in the 7th house from Pi may have resulted in bad relations with other nations
in  technical  matters.  After  the  nuclear  tests,  a  lot  of  curbs  were  imposed  by  the
western world on Indian institutions of science and technology.

93 Sudarsana Chakra dasa and Tajaka annual charts are treated this book as two closely linked topics.
When we say that Tajaka annual charts should be used, we automatically mean that Sudarsana Chakra
dasa should be used.
94 We can also say that muntha is in Pi in D-24.

35.4  Lunar charts

When Sun and Moon have an exact conjunction in every sign, it starts a new lunar
month.  When  Sun  and  Moon  conjoin  in  Pisces,  it  starts  a  new  lunar  year.  We  can
cast a chart at the exact moment of Sun-Moon conjunction at the capital of a country
and use it to predict the fortune of the nation in the upcoming month or year. We can
use  rasi  chart  as  well  as  divisional  charts.  For  timing  events,  we  can  compress
Vimsottari  dasa  from  120  years  to  a  lunar  month  or  a  lunar  year.  To  compress
Vimsottari dasa, follow this procedure:

(1) Find the constellation occupied by Moon and find its lord. His dasa comes first.
(2) If we are compressing from 120 years to 360 days (approximately a lunar year),
each  year  is  compressed  to  3  days.  So  Sun  dasa  becomes  18  days,  Moon  dasa
becomes  30  days  and  so  on.  If  we  are  compressing  from  120  years  to  30  days
(approximately a lunar month), 1 year becomes 0.25 days. So Sun dasa becomes
1.5 days, Moon dasa becomes 2.5 days and so on.

(3) We do not take the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon and decide the
remainder in first dasa based on that. We get better results by letting the complete
duration  of  the  first  dasa  come  together.  If  Moon  is  in  Sun’s  constellation  in  a
lunar new year chart, Sun dasa runs for the first 18 days.

(4) Go through the nine dasas in the same order as in Vimsottari dasa computed for
natal  charts.  The  only  difference  is  that  the  dasas  are  compressed  as  mentioned
above.

We  can  see  the  general  well-being  of  a  nation,  restlessness  of  people,  revolutions,
trade, wealth, mood of the nation, weather, natural calamiities etc in lunar charts.

Example 138: Let us take the 1992-93 lunar new year chart of India (see Chart 81).
In early December 1992, India was shaken by communal clashes in the aftermath of
the demolition of Babri Mosque in Ayodhya95.

95 Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Rama. According to a group of Indian scholars, Babri mosque
was originally a temple of Lord Rama in the sacred city and Muslim invader Babar converted it to a
mosque a few centuries ago. A political party wanted a Rama temple there. Though the mosque was
unused  for  a  long  time,  its  demolition  was  unacceptable  to  Muslim  leaders.  Against  court  orders,
activists  of  that  party  demolished  the  mosque  in  early  December  1992  and  it  led  to  communal
violence in different parts of India.

Part 5: Special Topics

465

Chart 81

Sun and Moon had a conjunction at 19 Pi 57 on 3rd April 1992  at 10:32  am (IST).
We cast a chart at New Delhi at that time and call that India’s lunar new year chart
for 1992-93.

  466

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

We  can  see  that  the  lagna-7th  axis  has  Ketu  and  Rahu.  Rahu’s  aspect  on  lagna  can
affect the general well-being of the nation and create turbulence. This can happen in
Rahu dasa. It may be noted that Mercury dasa runs first in this chart and Rahu dasa
runs in early December. With Rahu owning the 9th house, it had to do with religious
places.

In  addition  to  rasi  chart,  we  can  look  at  D-30.  It  shows  the  subconscious  forces
playing  a role in a native’s actions and his sins. In the case of a nation, it can show
internal turbulences, violence, riots etc. In D-30 (see Chart 81), Mars, Rahu and Ketu
afflict the 9th lord Jupiter in the 9th house. Again, this supports communal violence in
Rahu’s periods.

35.5  Solar charts

When  Sun  enters  a  rasi,  it  starts  a  new  solar  month.  We  can  cast  a  chart  for  that
moment  and  analyze  the  fortune  of  a  nation  during  the  solar  month.  In  particular,
charts cast when Sun enters the movable signs (Ar, Cn, Li and Cp) are important and
they  are  used  by  some  astrologers  to  predict  a  nation’s  fortune  during  a  3-month
period.

We  can  cast  the  solar  new  year  chart  when  Sun  enters  Aries,  the  first  sign  of  the
zodiac.  This  solar  new  year  is  celebrated  in  some  parts  of  India.  A  chart  cast  at  a
nation’s capital when Sun enters Aries can be used for predicting the nation’s fortune
for one year.

However, some astrologers prefer to use the chart when Sun enters Cp for predicting
the fortune for a year. They consider the solar ingress into Capricorn96 to be the most
important solar chart in Kali Yuga.

Solar  charts  are  good  at  showing  political  activity,  wars,  vitality  of  a  nation,
international  relations,  commerce  etc.  Narayana  dasa  and  other  rasi  dasas  can  be
compressed to one  year  (as in Tajaka charts) and used with solar charts.  They  give
better results than Vimsottari dasa in the case of solar charts.

96 This is celebrated in south India as “Makara Sankraanthi” or “Makara Sankramanam” or “Pongal”.

Part 5: Special Topics

467

Example  139:  Let  us  consider  Sun’s  Capricorn  ingress  chart  of  1998,  erected  at
India’s capital. India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. Let us consider D-24 (see
Chart 82).

Chart 82

D-24 shows activities related to learning, science and technology. Scorpio is the 8th
rasi  in  the  natural zodiac  and  it shows  hidden  things.  The  3rd  house  in  D-24  shows
weapons and aggressive technology. Rahu and Ketu in the 3rd house in Scorpio in D-
24 of the solar new year chart suggest hidden activities related to aggressive weapon
development  technology.  Lagna  lord  Mercury  is  in  the  6th  house  and  he  shows
enmity and poor relations with other nations in the matters of knowledge. This along
with  the  debilitation  of  Venus  can  explain  India’s  isolation  in  the  scientific  world
following the nuclear tests.

  468

35.6  Swearing-in Charts

We  can  cast  a  chart  when  a  new  leader  (the  chief  of  the  executive  wing  of
government) is sworn-in in a nation. That chart also has an impact on the nature of
results experienced by the nation during the leader’s tenure. We can  find Narayana
dasa  of  rasi  chart  and  divisional  charts  of  the  swearing-in  ceremony.  We  have  to
compress  Narayana  dasa  from  120  years  to  the  expected  maximum  length  of  the
tenure.

Example  140:  Let  us  take  Indian  Prime  Minister  Sri  A.B.  Vajpayee’s  swearing-in
ceremony of March 19, 1998. Let us study D-9 and look at the relations with other
nations (Chart 83).

Chart 83

An Indian Prime Minister’s tenure can be a maximum of 5 years. If we compress 120
years  of  Narayana  dasa  to  5  years  =  60  months,  i.e.  compress  each  year  to  half  a
month, we get dasas as given below:

Part 5: Special Topics

469

Aq (06 years):  Mar 1998 - Jun 1998
Cn (10 years):  Jun 1998 - Nov 1998
Sg (02 years):  Nov 1998 - Dec 1998
Ta (01 years):  Dec 1998 - Jan 1999
Li (08 years):  Jan 1999 - May 1999
Pi (01 years):  May 1999 - May 1999
Le (12 years):  May 1999 - Nov 1999

With Cn being the 6th house, its dasa brought bad relations with other nations. India
was isolated in the international community after the nuclear tests. Li is the 9th house
and it shows good diplomacy and excellent relations in navamsa. Its lord Venus is in
a trine. So Libra dasa saw Vajpayee promoting peace with a nation shown by Libra –
Pakistan – and the Lahore bus trip materialized in Li dasa.

About Le dasa, the following was written by this author in a magazine article97:

“Leo  dasa  of  six  months  will  run  from  May  19,  1999.  Leo  has
unobstructed argalas from two diplomatic planets – Moon and Venus. Leo
is  the  7th  house  and  it  contains  Sun  and  Rahu.  Rahu's  presence  may
indicate  unpleasant  confrontation  with  some  countries,  but  Sun  is  very

35.7  Conclusion

When we have the birthdata of a nation, we can use its birthchart. By the birth of a
nation,  we  mean  the  start  of  a  new  order  and  the  recognition  of  a  new  national
identity. We can cast  charts at a nation’s capital when a new solar or lunar  year or
month starts and use them to predict the fortune of a nation during the year or month.

Lunar  new  year  charts  are  free  from  errors  due  to  ayanamsa.  However,  solar  new
year  charts  are prone to  heavy errors if ayanamsa is erroneous.  If  ayanamsa has an
error of 1 arc-minute, this results in an error of 360 arc-minutes (i.e. 6º!) in lagna of
the solar new year chart. This is because lagna moves 360 times as fast as Sun. In the
time Sun takes to move by an angle of θ, lagna moves by an angle of (360xθ). So the
divisional  charts  of  solar  new  year  charts  will  not  give  consistent  results  until  our
ayanamsa is exact. It is not wise to assume that the ayanamsa one uses is perfect and
free from any error.

One  last  word  —  The  purpose  of  this  small  chapter  is  only  to  introduce  mundane
astrology  to  readers.  Interested  readers  may  refer  to  the  writings  on  mundane
astrology  by  great  authors  such  as  Varahamihira  and  Dr.B.V.Raman.  This  chapter
should only be a starting point.

36.  Muhurta or Electional Astrology

36.1  Introduction

When  a  person  is  born,  the  planetary  position  at  that  time  decides  how  his/her  life
progresses.  Similarly,  when  a  new  task  is  freshly  started,  the  planetary  position  at
that time decides how the task progresses. For example, the planetary position  at the
time one joins in a new job decides how one’s new job goes. The planetary position
at  the  time  one  starts  a  new  company  decides  the  fortune  of  the  company.  The
planetary position at the time of a wedding decides how the marriage goes.

For this reason, believers choose an auspicious time when starting new ventures. The
time  when  a  new  task  is  undertaken  is  called  “muhurta”.  One  can  select  a  good
muhurta  for  a  variety  of  tasks  –  getting  married,  joining  a  new  job,  swearing-in
ceremonies (in the case of political leaders), starting a new company, starting a kid’s
formal  education,  giving  cooked  rice  to  a  baby  for  the  first  time,  buying  a  vehicle,
buying  a  house,  housewarming,  babyshowers  etc.  The  list  is  endless.  In  India,  old
people choose a good muhurta even for getting a haircut or for cutting nails.

The  topic  of  muhurta  has  a  lot  of  controversies.  Different  guidelines  are  given  in
different classics and different conventions are in vogue in different regions of India.
Out  of  the  modern  books  on  muhurta  in  English  language,  the  one  by  Dr.  B.V.
Raman is very good.

36.2  Definition of Muhurta

Asrologers  set  nice  muhurtas  for  the  tasks  of  their  clients,  but  they  don’t  always
verify  that  their  clients  know  exactly  what  to  do  at  the  time  of  the  muhurta.  For
example,  if  we  set  an  auspicious  muhurta  for  someone  to  join  in  a  new  job,  what
should he do at the time? Should he sign the job offer letter? Or, should he sign the
employment contract (if applicable)? Or, should he sit in front of his computer and
power it on? Or, should he read a document describing the work he has to do? What
exactly should one do at the time of the muhurta set for joining in a new job?

  472

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

What is the definition of the time of marriage? What is the definition of the time of
joining  in  a  new  job?  What  is  the  definition  of  entering  a  new  house?  All  these
questions  are  not  clearly  answered  in  classics  and  we  have  to  draw  conclusions
intelligently.

Accepting a job offer is like conception. Starting the work is akin to a baby coming
out  of  mother’s  womb  and  starting  to  breathe  on  its  own.  Depending  on  what  one
does in a job, we can decide what “starting the work” means. It is not enough to sign
some papers, but one has to start some work at the time of a muhurta. In the case of a
marriage,  the  purpose  of  marriage  is  living  together.  Mangal  sutra  worn  by  a  lady
symbolizes it in Hindu culture. So the time when the bridegroom ties the knot is the
most appropriate. In the case of a Christian marriage, the time when the bride and the
bridegroom  are  pronounced  a  man  and  a  wife  after  saying  “I  do”  may  be  the  most
appropriate  time.  In  the  case  of  entering  a  new  house  (housewarming),  the  correct
time of entering the house is when one starts “living” in the house. One may not start
living in a house at the exact moment one enters a house with some suitcases. In the
Hindu  way  of  life,  only  a  house  where  cooking  is  done  is  a  place  of  living.  So,
traditionally, people warm milk on a stove at the time of muhurta. If milk is warmed
for making sweet rice for offering Gods as a prasaad, that symbolizes the starting of
life in the house. We have to decide intelligently on a case by case basis.

36.3  Basics of Muhurta

Tithi,  yoga,  karana,  weekday  and  nakshatra  form  the  5  limbs  of  “panchaanga”99.
When  deciding  a  muhurta,  we  try  to  choose  a  good  tithi,  weekday,  yoga,  karana,
nakshatra and lagna. For each task, there are certain tithis, weekdays, nakshatras and
lagnas that are preferred. The nakshatra occupied by Moon at the time of a muhurta
should  be  a  good  tara  with  respect  to  janma  nakshatra.  In  addition,  lord  of  the
running  hora  (hour)  should  be  a  favorable  planet  in  the  natal  chart,  especially  with
respect to the house to which the activity belongs. For example, hora at the time of
wedding should belong to a favorable planet in the natal chart with respect to the 7th
house and upapada. Hora at the time of moving to a new house should belong to a
favorable  planet  in  the  natal  chart  with  respect  to  the  4th  house  and  A4.  If  a  planet
owns the 8th house from the 4th house and occupies a badhaka sthana from A4, then it

99 Panchaanga means an almanac that lists auspicious and inauspicious times. It literally means “one
with five limbs”.

A  list  of  the  common  guidelines  is  given  in  Table  79.  These  are  merely  guidelines
and  not  final  recommendations.  The  recommendation  in  the  case  of  a  wedding
muhurta,  for  example,  is  to  keep  the  7th  house  empty.  However,  expert  astrologers
flout these norms often, with considerable success.

Part 5: Special Topics

475

The  basic  point  in  keeping  the  7th  house  empty  in  a  wedding  muhurta  is  to  avoid
afflictions  there.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  7th  house  is  occupied  by  benefics  giving
great yogas, how can that cause problems in marriage?

Planetary strength is more important than strictly following these thumbrules.

36.4  Planetary Strength

Though  a  lot  of  thumbrules  are  given  in  literature,  an  intelligent  astrologer  gives
more  importance  to  the  strength  of  planets  in  the  muhurta  chart  than  those
thumbrules.  Not  only  should  the  rasi  chart  be  strong,  but  also  the  concerned
divisional  chart  should  be  strong.  For  example,  for  joining  a  new  job,  lagna,  6th
house  and  10th  house  should  be  strong  in  rasi  and  D-10  charts.  When  starting  a
child’s education, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th should be strong in rasi and D-24 charts. When
buying a new vehicle, 1st and 4th houses (and A4) should be strong in rasi and D-16
charts.  When  entering  a  new  house,  the  1st  and  4th  from  lagna  and  Venus  in  D-4
should be strong. When buying some real estate, the 1st and 4th from lagna and Mars
in D-4 should be strong.

We can use Vimsottari dasa to time the progress of a task started at a muhurta. If we
know the maximum time period for which the task started at a muhurta can last, we
can compress Vimsottari dasa to that period. Details of the computation can be found
in topic 35.4 in the chapter on “Mundane Astrology”. If the task started at a muhurta
has no fixed time period of effect, we can take Vimsottari dasa of 120 years.

In  addition  to  planetary  strength,  we  should  ensure  that  the  first  dasa  as  per
Vimsottari  dasa  belongs  to  a  favorable  planet  in  the  chart.  The  effect  of  a  muhurta
lasts only for a few months or a couple of years and the strength of one’s natal chart
is  more  important  in  the  long-run.  So  the  first  dasa  as  per  Vimsottari  dasa  is
important. For example, we may select a muhurta with excellent rasi and D-10 charts
for  joining  in  a  new  job  and  yet  bad  results  may  be  experienced  if  the  first  dasa
belongs to the 8th lord in D-10.

Example  141:  Let  us  consider  the  muhurta  chart  used  by  Sri  A.B.  Vajpayee  for
swearing-in as India’s Prime Minister in May 1996 (see Chart 84).

  476

Chart 84

In rasi chart, lagna lord Sun is in 10th and 10th lord Venus is in 11th. The 5th house is
important for power and it contains its lord Jupiter. The 9th house of fortune is also
very  strong.  On  the  whole,  the  chart  is  strong.  Unfavorable  sakuna  karana  was

Part 5: Special Topics

477

running  at  the  time.  Chaturdasi  tithi  (14th  lunar  day)  is  usually  not  considered
auspicious, but its ruler Venus owns the 10th house here and it is acceptable. Overall,
rasi chart is acceptable.

However, D-30 is weak. D-30 shows past and present evils and the punishment. To
see an early death, it is an apt chart. Venus owns the 2nd and 7th houses in D-30 here.
He is a strong maraka (killer). He afflicts lagna. Lagna lord of rasi chart (Sun) is in
the  2nd  house  in  D-30.  Because  of  these,  there  was  a  premature  end.  The  fact  that
Venus dasa was running at muhurta – Moon  was in a  Venusian constellation – did
not  help  either.  Sri  Vajpayee  remained  in  power  only  for  13  days.  However,  the
strength of rasi chart ensured his return within a couple of years.

Example  142:  Sri  Vajpayee  returned  to  power  in  March  1998.  Let  us  consider  the
swearing-in muhurta used this time (see Chart 85).

Chart 85

Lagna lord is in 9th with Uttamaamsa. Saturn owns 9th and 10th and he is in 11th with
Uttamaamsa. The chart is basically strong. However, 3rd lord Moon is debilitated in

  478

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

7th and that is not conducive to a long life. Situation of Gulika within 1º from lagna is
also undesirable.

Because  of  the  drawbacks,  Sri  Vajpayee  lost  the  vote  of  confidence  in  April  1999.
However,  the  opposition  parties  could  not  offer  an  alternative  and  Vajpayee
remained as the caretaker Prime Minister. The position of his party improved in the
October  1999  elections  and  he  continued  as  PM.  Let  us  time  the  setbacks  of  April
1999  using  Vimsottari  dasa  compressed  to  5  years.  We  can  see  that  the  8th
constellation Satabhisha falls in Aq and it is stronger than Moon’s constellation, as
Jupiter and Ketu occupy it. For matters related to longevity, we can use  Vimsottari
dasa  started  from  the  8th  constellation  as  it  is  stronger.  Using  this  dasa,  Ketu
antardasa  in  Jupiter  dasa  ran  during  April  3-17,  1999.  Venus  antardasa  ran  for  the
next  40  days.  With  Jupiter  owning  the  8th  house,  Jupiter  dasa  was  full  of  troubles.
Ketu is the co-lord of the 7th house and he afflicts 8th lord. This resulted in the fall of
the government. However, the next antardasa belonged to lagna lord Venus, who is
the  lord  of  Sanjivani  mantra100.  So  Sri  Vajpayee  wasn’t  replaced  by  another  leader
and he remained as the caretaker PM.

Example 143: Let us consider the muhurta at which this author started writing this
book  (see  Chart  86).  Tithi  is  Saptami  –  an  auspicious  tithi.  Yoga  is  Vriddhi  yoga
(growth). Karana is Vanija.

In rasi chart, lagna lord Moon occupies lagna in Paarijaataamsa. Lagna and Moon are
in  a  constellation  of  Mercury,  significator  of  writing.  The  11th  house  of  gains  has
Venus in own sign in Gopuraamsa. The 10th house of karma (action) has exalted 2nd
lord Sun and 3rd lord Mercury. The 2nd house is important for astrological knowledge
and the 3rd house shows writing. Both Sun and Mercury are in Paarijaataamsa. Lord
of 10th house (Mars) is a yogakaraka here and he is in Gopuraamsa in the 2nd house.
This parivartana (exchange of houses) between the 2nd and 10th lords is favorable for
karma related to astrology. Jupiter is the significator of astrology and he has a close
aspect on lagna and Moon. He aspects the 3rd house of writing also.

However,  Jupiter  is  debilitated.  For  an  activity  related  to  astrology,  Jupiter’s
debilitation is not good. The 3rd house of writing has Rahu in it. Saturn owns the 8th
house  and  he  aspects  the  3rd  house.  Saturn’s  aspect  on  the  house  of  interest  is  not

100 This mantra can bring a dead person to life.

Part 5: Special Topics

479

good. Aspect of the 8th lord is not  good either. Rahu in 3rd  also shows obstacles in
writing. Then, why did this author choose this muhurta?

Chart 86

  480

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

(1) Lagna,  2nd,  5th,  10th  and  11th  are  strong.  The  3rd  lord  has  a  good  placement,

though 3rd is afflicted.

(2) Jupiter’s aspect is always good in astrological activities. If Jupiter is weak, it can
denote  initial  setbacks.  But  Jupiter’s  close  aspect  on  lagna  and  lagna  lord  can
only be beneficial in the long run.

(3) Hora  of  Jupiter  runs  at  the  time  of  muhurta.  Jupiter  occupies  the  2nd  house  of
speech  in  this  author’s  natal  chart.  In  his  natal  D-24,  Jupiter  occupies  Pi  (10th
house) and shows saattwik activities in society related to fine knowledge. A3 is
in  Pi  in  natal  D-10  and  Jupiter  owns  it.  From  A3  in  D-24,  he  is  the  2nd and  5th
lord and occupies the 5th house (in own rasi). So Jupiter’s hora is very favorable
for starting astrological writing.

(4) More importantly, the Navamsa chart is strong.

If one’s aim in writing a textbook on Vedic astrology is to contribute to a renaissance
in  Vedic  astrology  and  to  serve  astrology  researchers,  then  Navamsa  is  more
important than Rasi. Navamsa is the chart that shows how one follows one’s dharma
(duty). So the strength of Navamsa is very important.

In  navamsa  (see  Chart  86),  lagna  is  in  Pisces,  a  saattwik  sign  owned  by  Jupiter.
Jupiter aspects lagna from 7th. Navamsa lagna is in the 9th from Rasi lagna. Exalted
3rd lord Venus is in lagna and he owns the 11th house in Rasi chart. This is favorable
to  fulfilling  one’s  dharma  related  to  writing.  Mercury  occupies  the  3rd  house  in
Navamsa  and  he  owns  the  3rd  house  in  Rasi.  This  again  shows  using  good
communication  skills  in  fulfilling  dharma.  Mars  is  strong  in  the  9th  house  in  own
sign. The 9th house must be strong in Navamsa for a dharmik activity. Sun is in 10th
in both Rasi and Navamsa and that shows some recognition. Ketu is in the 5th house
in  Navamsa.  This  combination,  if  present  in  a  natal  Navamsa,  makes  one  good  at
mathematics  as  per  Jaimini  Maharshi.  Here,  this  combination  makes  an  analytical
approach possible.

In the Rasi  chart, Aries  is an important rasi as it contains 2nd lord Sun and 3rd lord
Mercury. Saturn, who owns the 8th house in this chart, was transiting in Aries during
1998-2000.  During  this  transit,  progress  wasn’t  made.  After  Jupiter  entered  Aries,
this  author  became  determined  to  restart  the  project.  In  April  2000,  Sun  entered
Aries, his muhurta position, and the project was restarted with newfound vigor. Due
to  the  presence  of  Mercury,  Jupiter  and  Venus  in  Aries,  May  2000  was  a  very
productive  period.  After  3  years  of  contemplation  and  slow  (no)  progress,  almost

Part 5: Special Topics

481

40% of this book was written in April-May 2000. After Saturn left Aries, the other
60% of this book was finished.

As  this  example  illustrates,  we  can  use  transits  with  muhurtas.  Rasi  is  the  chart  of
physical manifestation; navamsa is the chart of dharma and inner self; and, dasamsa
is  the  chart  of  achievements  in  society.  So  transits  with  respect  to  Rasi  chart  are
important  in  figuring  out  when  the  book  is  finished.  Transits  with  respect  to
Navamsa  chart  are  important  in  figuring  out  when  and  whether  the  book  serves  its
intended  purpose.  Transits  with  respect  to  Dasamsa  chart  are  important  in  figuring
out  how  the  book  is  received  and  when  and  whether  it  becomes  popular.  Thus  we
can adapt the meanings of divisional charts to muhurtas.

36.5  Conclusion

For standard principles related to muhurtas, readers can refer to other books. In this
book,  the  importance  of  analyzing  planetary  positions  as  in  natal  charts  is
emphasized, as many books leave out this important aspect. One should analyze the
rasi and relevant divisional charts of a muhurta just as in the case of natal charts.

37.  Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi

Jyotisha  is  the  Sanskrit  name  of  Vedic  astrology.  One  who  practices  Jyotisha  is
called  a  Jyotishi.  Vedas  are  the  sacred  scriptures  of  Hinduism.  Veda  simply  means
“Knowledge”.  Jyotisha  is  called  a  “Vedaanga”  (a  limb  of  Vedas).  In  particular,
Jyotisha  is  called  the  eye  of  Vedas.  It  is  the  science  of  light  and  the  eye  of
knowledge.

To  its  believers,  Vedic  astrology  is  not  just  another  subject  like  mathematics  and
physics. It is considered a sacred subject. It gives its knower a special power to see
the  past,  the  present  and  the  future.  Such  fine  knowledge  cannot  reach  an
irresponsible person. So Maharshis have set some guidelines for the ethical behavior
of  Jyotishis.  This  author  hopes  that  the  readers  of  this  book  abide  by  those
guidelines.

One  should  give  this  knowledge  to  worthy,  honest  and  god-fearing  students  who
have  great  respect  for  their  teacher  and  who  speak  truth  always.  In  Indian  culture,
one’s relationship with a giver of knowledge is that of a servant with one’s master.
Just as a servant obeys each command of his master, a student obeys each command
of his teacher. A wealthy man may give his servant only some money, but a teacher
gives  his  students  knowledge  and  knowledge  is  considered  to  be  the  most  valuable
asset  in  Indian  culture.  So  teachers  are  treated  with  utmost  respect.  This  may  be
tough  to  understand  and  appreciate,  for  readers  from  western  cultures  where
knowledge is a commodity with a limited value.

Maharshis advised that one benefits by teaching Jyotisha to god-fearing students who
treat  their  teacher  with  utmost  respect  and  speak  truth.  On  the  other  hand,  one
becomes sad everyday by teaching Jyotisha to atheists, liars and deceitful people.

In Kali Yuga, it may be difficult to find ideal students for this subject. Nevertheless,
one  should  not  teach  this  subject  to  unwilling  people  and  unbelievers.  This
knowledge should be given only to the worthy students.

Jyotishis should also maintain dignity when offering astrological consultations. They
should  approach  astrological  consultations  with  the  spirit  of  service.  They  possess

Part 5: Special Topics

483

special  knowledge  of  a  sacred  subject  and  they  should  help  those  who  need
guidance.  Jyotishis  should  be  spiritually  oriented  and  they  should  realize  that  their
knowledge is priceless. Instead of running after material possessions, they should be
happy with their knowledge and help people in need without expecting anything in
return.

Accumulating  wealth  and  material  possessions  gives  only  temporary  happiness.  It
may make one happy for 10 years or 50 years or 100 years. But when one dies and
takes birth again, one loses all that. All these material possessions cannot be carried
with one. A greedy person will only struggle in the infinite cycle of life, death and
rebirth. Things can get only worse for a greedy person with each new life.

Just as one who does not exercise accumulates a lot of body fat which is a liability, a
greedy person accumulates a lot of sin which becomes a liability in the cycle of life,
death  and  rebirth.  On  the  other  hand,  an  austere  person  who  punishes  himself  by
denying comforts burns away the sins of past lives, just as one who troubles his body
with regular exercise burns the body fat. So a wise person doesn’t run after material
possessions and tries to be austere.

An austere Jyotishi who serves humanity with his/her divine knowledge of Jyotisha
burns away  past sins and gets closer  and closer  to liberation from the  cycle of life,
death and rebirth.

One  should  always  be  positive  when  making  predictions.  Negative  predictions
should  be  made  with  a  restrained  tone.  A  Jyotishi  may  gently  caution  the  clients
about  an  impending  danger  and  suggest  remedial  measures  and  precautions,  but  he
should  not  scare  the  clients.  Negative  predictions  should  be  made  only  when  some
preventive  action  is  suggested.  Negative  predictions  made  just  for  fame  or  the
sensation  value  bring  unhappiness  to  the  Jyotishi.  Jyotishis  should  try  to  bring
spiritual awareness in their clients and try to promote righteousness. Jyotisha should
never be a business. It should be a spiritual service.

With deep respect for my gurus and maharshis, I shared my limited knowledge with
the readers. May the readers of this book use the privileged knowledge of the divine
subject  of  Jyotisha  in  the  spirit  of  compassionate  and  selfless  service  and  work  for
the uplifting of humanity!

Examples

The “exercises” one encounters in real life can be considerably
more  complicated  than  the  tailor-made  exercises  given  in  this
book.  The  exercises  given  in  this  book  familiarize  the  reader
with  various  techniques,  but  making  real-life  predictions
requires more than that.

To  illustrate  the  process  of  making  predictions,  some  real-life
situations that this author faced in his experience will be given.
The process of synthesizing a prediction will be illustrated in as
much  detail  as  possible.  These  examples  are  meant  for  giving
some  guidance  and  inspiration  to  those  who  are  new  to  the
process of making predictions.

Part 6: Real-life Examples

487

Real-life Example 1:

Birthdata  of  a  lady  is  given  in  Chart  87.  Her  parents  consulted  the  author  in  early
1997 and wanted to know exactly when she would get married.

For marriage, we should see rasi and navamsa charts (see Chart 87). Vimsottari dasa
of  Jupiter  started  in  mid-1996.  Can  Jupiter  give  marriage?  Well,  he  must.  Because
this  dasa  started  at  an  age  of  23,  it  will  run  till  an  age  of  39.  So  Jupiter  must  give
marriage.  Being  lagna  lord  in  11th,  he  can  give  all-round  progress.  Moreover,  he
aspects the 7th house Virgo and 7th lord Mercury here. So he can give marriage.

Who  is  the  7th  lord?  In  rasi,  7th  lord  is  Mercury.  In  D-9,  7th  is  in  Cp  and  its  lord
Saturn aspects it from Sc. So Saturn antardasa can give marriage. When is it? It starts
in the second half of 1998. But her parents already started looking for a match and
Saturn antardasa is too late. Can Jupiter antardasa itself give marriage? It is not very
likely.

Where  will  Jupiter  be  in  late  1998?  He  will  be  transiting  in  Aq.  Can  Jupiter’s  Aq
transit give marriage? It doesn’t look too interesting. Pi transit is a better candidate.
As Pi is natal lagna, Jupiter’s Pi transit can bring all-round progress. From Pi, Jupiter
will aspect Vi, the 7th house. He will also aspect Cn. Note that Cn contains 7th lord
Mercury in rasi chart. In D-9, it contains lagna & Mercury. So Jupiter’s Pisces dasa
in 1999 can bring marriage.

The  pratyantardasa  running  then  is  Mercury’s  (Jan-May  1999).  With  Mercury
owning the 7th house in rasi and occupying lagna in D-9, his PD can give marriage.
He is also DK.

To be sure, check Sudarsana Chakra dasa. On her birthday in 1998, she finishes 1998
– 1973 = 25 years and starts the 26th year. Subtracting multiples of 12 from 26, we
get 2. So dasa of the 2nd house runs. In navamsa, it is Leo. At the time of the start of
this  dasa  (i.e.  Tajaka  annual  chart  of  1998-99),  Jupiter  occupies  Leo  and  Venus
occupies  Aquarius  (see  Chart  74).  That  is  favorable.  So  marriage  can  take  place  in
the year (1998-99).

  488

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 87

In  Tajaka  annual  chart,  lagna  lord  and  2nd  lord  have  an  exchange.  The  2nd  house
shows family. Vivaha saham is in Sc. Mars owns it. Mars is also muntha lord. He has
a  very  close  ithasala  with  Venus,  the  natural  significator  of  marriage  and  upapada
lord. In navamsa, Mars is very strong in his moolatrikona Aries. He is in the 2nd from

Part 6: Real-life Examples

489

lagna and 9th from muntha. Patyayini dasa of Venus runs during Dec 98 and Jan 99.
Patyayini dasa of Mars runs during Feb-Mar 99.

In  1999,  the  lunar  month  of  Maagha  ends  in  mid-February.  It  brings  the  season  of
marriages in India, because it is thought to be an auspicious month for marriages. So
probably marriage will take place in that month.

So the final prediction given was – “she may get married in the first half of February
1999”.  Because  upapada  is  in  Li  in  rasi  chart,  she  was  advised  to  pray  to  goddess
Lakshmi everyday and especially on Fridays.

She got married at the end of Jan 1999 and went to USA with her husband in early
Feb 1999.

Real-life Example 2:

A  noted  Vedic  astrologer  of  the  west  was  expecting  a  child  in  November  1999.  At
the  end  of  October  1999,  he  mentioned  on  an  internet-based  forum  for  Vedic
astrology  discussions101  that  his  child  would  be  born  in  a  few  weeks.  He  did  not
mention how many children he already had or what the due date for this new child
was.

Later he expressed a desire on the forum to learn the computation of Narayana dasa
for  divisional  charts.  This  author  wanted  to  illustrate  the  computation  using  the
gentleman’s D-7, as he was expecting a child. His birthdata and natal D-7 are given
in Chart 88.

Lagna in rasi chart is in Sc. The 7th house is in Ta. Its lord is Venus. He is in Ge in
D-7 and Ge is stronger than Sg. So dasas start from Ge. Because Ge is a dual sign,
we use the trinal progression of Vishnu. Because the 9th from Ge (i.e. Aq) is an even-
footed sign, we go backward. So dasas go as Ge, Aq, Li, Vi, Ta, Cp, Sg, Le, Ar, Pi,
Sc and Cn. It can be seen that Le dasa runs during 1988-2000.

It can be seen that exalted Jupiter is stronger than lagna in D-7 and he can be used as
a reference. The 1st, 2nd and 5th lords from him are Moon, Sun and Mars and they are

101 http://www.egroups.com/group/vedic-astrology

  490

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

all conjoined in Leo. So  Leo is a very important sign in this D-7.  Its dasa can give
children.

Chart 88

Let us find antardasas. Because Le is stronger, antardasas start from its lord Sun. He
is in Le, an odd sign. So antardasas go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc. During 1999-2000, the
12th antardasa of Cn runs. It contains exalted Jupiter and it can give a child.

Pratyantardasas in Cn dasa start from Moon and again they go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc.
March  13-April  13  is  the  first  pratyantardasa.  October  15-November  15  is  the  8th
pratyantardasa  of  Pisces.  From  November  15,  Aries  pratyantardasa  runs.  Which  is
more likely to give a child?

Pisces is the 11th house and contains the 5th lord Mercury. Mercury is also PK. He is
in a trine from exalted Jupiter. So Pisces pratyantardasa is more likely to give a child.

Before  it  can  be  mentioned  in  public,  it  can  be  quickly  cross-checked  using  the
Tajaka annual chart of 1999-2000 (see Chart 89).

Part 6: Real-life Examples

491

Chart 89

In this chart, putra saham is in Cancer. Its lord Moon is in the 5th house of children.
He  has  a  very  close  half-degree  ithasala  with  lagna  lord  Mercury.  He  also  has  an
ithasala  with  Jupiter,  natural  significator  of  children.  In  D-7,  the  5th  house  is

  492

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

occupied by Mercury and Jupiter. Moon owns lagna and occupies 3rd (11th from 5th,
showing the gain of a child).

All these factors suggest a child in the dasa of Moon, who emerges as an important
planet  in  rasi  and  D-7.  However,  Moon’s  dasa  comes  during  June-July.  Lagna’s
Patyayini  dasa  runs  during  Oct  29-Nov  23  and  Sun’s  dasa  comes  after  it.  This
gentleman said on Oct 29 that he was expecting a child in a few weeks. So it has to
be either lagna’s dasa or Sun’s dasa. Compared to Sun dasa, lagna’s dasa is a better
candidate.  Usually  lagna’s  dasa  brings  important  results.  Antardasa  is  likely  to  be
Moon’s. Moon’s antardasa runs on Nov 14-15. This agrees with the indication from
D-7 Narayana dasa, viz child-birth before Nov 15.

After  this  analysis,  an  e-mail  was  sent  to  the  forum  giving  the  computation  of  the
gentleman’s  D-7  Narayana  dasa.  It  was  mentioned  that  he  might  get  a  child  before
November 15.

The  gentleman  clarified  later  that  the  date  given  by  doctors  was  November  23.  He
said that it was the third child and the ultra-sound scan predicted a daughter. The 3rd
child is shown by the 9th lord in D-7. Debilitated Mercury is the 9th lord from lagna
in  D-7  (counted  in  reverse).  Debilitated  planets  show  a  daughter.  Mercury  also
shows  a  daughter.  We  can  now  be  more  confident  about  child-birth  in  the
pratyantardasa  of  Pisces  as  per  D-7  Narayana  dasa,  because  Pisces  represents  the
third  child  in  this  D-7.  So  no  changes  were  made  based  on  the  additional
information.

The gentleman informed this author by personal e-mail later that he was blessed with
a daughter on November 14.

Real-life Example 3:

Consider the native whose D-10 is given in Chart 90. He came to this author in May
1998 and asked if there was a change of job for him. This author checked his D-10
Narayana  dasa.  It  may  be  noted  that  Cp  dasa  of  10  years  runs  during  1989-1999.
Antardasa  running  in  March  1998-January  1999  is  that  of  Aries.  It  is  the  8th  house
from A10 (which can show the workplace) and its lord is in the 12th from A10. So a
change of job or turbulence at workplace is possible.

Part 6: Real-life Examples

493

Chart 90

Because Ar contains AL and it is a trine from lagna, its antardasa is likely to be good
for career and status. However, its lord Mars is with Rahu in the 8th house from the
dasa  rasi  Cp.  So  this  indicates  pressures  and  undesirable  developments  too.  This
seems to suggest worries at the current job and then move to a new job with higher
status.

This can be cross-checked with D-10 of Tajaka  annual chart of 1998-99  (see Chart
91). AL in D-10 contains its lord Rahu and the other lord Saturn is in the 5th house
from  it.  These  factors  suggest  good  status  in  career  in  the  year.  However,  Venus
owns the 7th from lagna (dealings with others) and the 9th from AL (fortune) and he
is  debilitated.  This  does  suggest  some  setbacks.  Moreover,  Saturn  and  Sun  aspect
each other in D-10. This shows trouble from authorities.

Let us check Tajaka monthly charts (Chart 92). In Tajaka monthly chart of May 26-
June 26, 1998, lagna lord in D-10 is Venus and he is in the 12th house with exalted
Sun, again supporting trouble from authorities. Moon and Mercury are with Ketu and
Rahu respectively and it does not suggest a happy mental and emotional state, as far
as work is concerned. However, in D-10 of the next month’s chart, lagna lord Jupiter

  494

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

is in 10th in moolatrikona. Despite other weaknesses, this brings strength to D-10. In
rasi chart also, 10th lord Mercury is in own rasi Ge (7th house) with 9th lord Sun and
this shows good developments in career.

Based  on  all  these  factors,  it  was  predicted  that  the  native’s  relationship  with  his
managers could deteriorate, he could be frustrated in June, he could be forced out of
his job and he would join a better job in July.

Chart 91

It happened as predicted. At the time of the original prediction, this author looked at
Narayana dasa only upto antardasas. After he knew that the prediction came true, he
checked  pratyantardasas  (PD)  in  retrospect.  Scorpio’s  PD  was  running  in  June.
Because  of  the  presence  of  8th  lord  and  debilitated  Moon,  its PD  brought  pressures
and frustration.  The conjunction of 8th and 12th lords can give a Viparita Raja Yoga,
but that can be effective only when the planets are in a dusthana in weakness or in a
quadrant/trine in strength. Here Moon is debilitated and they are in a quadrant.

Part 6: Real-life Examples

495

Chart 92

  496

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

After the frustration in Sc dasa given by debilitated Moon, next PD of Sg during July
brought success. He joined a better job. Because Sun is lagna lord and the lord of 5th
from  AL  and  because  he  occupies  a  trine  from  AL,  this  PD  can  be  good  for
professional status. Because of his rasi aspect on Pi (GL), Sun can give a promotion
also. Moreover, Sun is the planet of authority. So Sg antardasa gave a new job with a
higher status.

The native came to this author again in May 1999. He was planning to buy a house
in USA and wondered if his career would be stable or if it would be a mistake to buy
a house.

Le  dasa  runs  during  1999-2007.  Because  Le  is  lagna  and  the  5th  from  AL,  its  dasa
has to be good. Antardasa of Sg was running till Sept 1999 and it would be excellent
for reasons already mentioned. So the native was told that there was nothing to worry
about and he might in fact have a promotion in the next few months. That came true
and his position improved at his new company.

Before we close this example, readers may note one thing. Lagna is in Pi, GL is in
Sg  and  HL  is  in  Ta  in  his  natal  rasi  chart.  So  Venus  owns  HL,  occupies  GL  and
aspects lagna (by rasi aspect). For these reasons, Venus is a yogada (giver of yoga).
His dasa must be excellent from the point of view of power as well as money. In rasi
chart,  Venus  owns  the  8th  house  and  he  occupies  lagna  with  Rahu  in  D-4.  These
factors can suggest that his yoga will be in a foreign land. Vimsottari dasa of Venus
started in April 1997 (using 360-day savana years) and the native left India and went
to USA in April/May 1997. Venus dasa is likely to continue to be good for his career
and finances.

Real-life Example 4:

On an internet-based Vedic astrology discussion forum, a noted Vedic astrologer of
west  gave  the  birthdata  of  her  friend’s  son,  who  was  nominated  for  an  academy
award (Oscar). The awards were to be announced at a function in Los Angeles on the
night of March 26, 2000. The lady wanted to know if her friend’s son would get an
award or not.

Part 6: Real-life Examples

  498

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 94

For  someone  in  the  entertainment  business,  an  Oscar  nomination  itself  is  a  major
achievement. We cannot look at the dasas one is running and conclude whether one
will  win  the  award  or  not.  Because  of  the  nomination,  one  will  get  a  lot  of  good
publicity.  If  one  doesn’t  get  the  award,  one  may  be  unhappy  on  that  night  and  the

Part 6: Real-life Examples

499

next  couple  of  days.  We  cannot  say  that  one  will  not  get  the  award  because  a  bad
pratyantardasa  is  running  or  that  one  will  get  the  award  because  a  good
pratyantardasa  is  running.  We  need  to  go  much  deeper  and  look  at  the  1-2  days
surrounding the award. We need to understand the native’s mood on the morning of
March 27. That alone can say whether the native won the award on March 26 or not.
Irrespective of whether one wins the award or not, a few weeks before March 26 and
a  few  months  after  March  26  are  bound  to  be  excellent  in  the  native’s  career.  The
mood on March 27 is the clinching factor.

Rasi  and  D-10  of  Tajaka  monthly  chart  of  March  14-April  14,  2000  are  given  in
Chart 93. Saturn’s Patyayini dasa runs during March 26-April 3. Saturn is the 6th and
7th  lord  in  D-10  and  he  shows  rivals  (6th)  and  contacts  (7th)  in  the  entertainment
business.  His  exaltation  may  show  meeting  some  important  people.  However,
exaltation  of  6th  lord  is  not  favorable.  Moreover  Saturn  is  debilitated  in  6th  in  rasi
chart.  That  can  show  disappointments.  So  meeting  with  important  people,  getting
disappointed  and  making  important  contacts  may  be  the  results  given  by  Saturn.
However, we should focus on the 60-hour period for a better idea.

Rasi and D-10 of Tajaka sixty-hour chart of March 26-28, 2000  are  given in Chart
94. This chart covers the period that starts in the afternoon of March 26 and lasts 2.5
days. In rasi chart, lagna has Rahu in it. Lagna lord is debilitated in 5th, the house of
emotions.  The  strength  of  the  10th  house  shows  a  good  development  in  career
(attending the Oscar night), but the weakness of lagna lord shows a disappointment.
In D-10, lagna lord is in 8th and 8th lord is in lagna.

So it was predicted on the forum that the native was unlikely to win the award. Later,
the lady who gave this chart informed the forum that her friend’s son did not win the
academy award.

Real-life Example 5:

When working on the birthtime rectification of a lady whose navamsa chart is given
in  Chart  95,  this  author  wanted  to  guess  when  her  marriage  took  place.  He  first
looked at Vimsottari dasa. Mercury dasa runs during 1983-1999. Because Mercury is
the 7th lord in 7th in navamsa, his dasa can give marriage. Because Mars owns the 2nd
house  and  upapada  and  joins  lagna  lord,  his  antardasa  can  give  marriage.  Jupiter’s
antardasa can also give marriage.

  500

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Chart 95

We  can  cross-check  with  Kalachakra  dasa.  Sg  dasa  runs  from  1988-1998.  For  an
Indian girl, this is the normal age of getting married. So irrespective of planets, this
must be the dasa of marriage.  In any  case, Venus occupies Sg here and it can  give
marriage. Antardasa can belong to the 7th house Virgo containg Mercury. It can also
be Gemini owned and aspected by the 7th lord. Gemini is the 7th house from Venus
and from dasa rasi. Gemini antardasa runs from Sept 1991 to Aug 1992.

Next, this author checked the Tajaka annual chart of 1991-92 (see Chart 96). Vivaha
saham is at 22Ge54, i.e. in the 7th house. Venus is the significator of marriage and he
is at 21Ge11. The situation of Venus in the 7th house very close to vivaha saham very
strongly indicates marriage in the year, perhaps in the Patyayini dasa of Venus.

Mercury is the 7th lord and vivaha saham lord. He is at 13Ar37. Lagna lord Jupiter is
at  13Cn52.  There  is  a  square  aspect  between  the  two  planets.  Because  Mercury  is
behind  Jupiter  by  one  quarter  of  a  degree,  there  is  a  very  “poorna  (complete)
ithasala” between them. This also makes marriage extremely likely in the year.

Part 6: Real-life Examples

501

Chart 96

In  navamsa,  Venus  owns  the  7th  house  and  occupies  lagna.  Mercury,  lord  of  7th  in
rasi chart, occupies a trine in navamsa and joins navamsa lagna lord. (NOTE: If the 7th
lord in rasi chart is well-placed in navamsa, it is good. The 7th lord in rasi shows the
partner in physical life and navamsa shows inner self and dharma.)

  502

Vedic Astrology: An Integrated Approach

Venus  dasa  as  per  annual  Patyayini  dasa  runs  from  9th  Nov  1991  to  7th  Feb  1992.
Venus-Mercury  antardasa runs during  February  5-7, 1992. So this author asked the
lady, “did you get married in the first week of February 1992?” The lady was not a
great believer in astrology and she was amazed. She said yes.

At that time, this author did not compute compressed Narayana dasa, but readers can
verify  that  compressed  D-9  Narayana  dasa  of  Cn  runs  during  Feb  5-20,  1992.  Her
marriage took place then and Cn contains upapada in navamsa (see Chart 96).

One Last Word

The purpose of these examples is not to brag about some correct predictions. Every
astrologer makes hundreds or thousands of correct predictions and possibly hundreds
of  wrong  predictions  too.  I  also  made  many  correct  predictions  and  many  wrong
predictions. The purpose of the above examples is to illustrate the process of making
predictions  and  to  give  guidance  to  those  who  are  new  to  the  process  of  making
predictions.

I  earnestly hope that  readers pursue this divine subject in the right spirit, master it,
serve their clients sincerely and contribute to a renaissance in Jyotish.

I again humbly request elders and scholars to correct my mistakes. May I be forgiven
for my mistakes and excesses.

I bow with gratitude before Lord Jagannatha for making me write this book. May He
continue to stand in the path of my eyes!

May all people be happy!

 May we find Truth from Falsehood!
May we find Light from Darkness!
May we find the Nectar of Immortality from Death!
Let there be Peace, Peace, Peace!!
